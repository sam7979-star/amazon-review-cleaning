about amazonbasics amazon basics was launched in is amazons own inhouse brand for fast moving small electronic consumer goods here amazon uses its massive collection of sales data to launch products that are in huge demand already exist in the market but at lower prices simply put up similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices if something isnt an immediate hit amazon pulls it and moves on amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides portal for various sellers to sell their product but with amazonbasics amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers hence amazonbasics branded products are available for lower price attracting bulk customers online as an additional benefit amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined immediately taken care of about our product requirement vs actual recently purchased new qualcomm qbix car charger was looking for cable with usb to micro connector listed my priorities under various heads to come up with conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements data exchange since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car data exchange capability was not much of my concern preference though would surely have been usb but it didnt bother me if could only get usb too actual product did try to copy movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and found it to be pretty well did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred the more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed length of the cable again since could not afford to have lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob preferred to keep it short simple hence my only lookout was upto around meter or below actual product the cable came nicely packed in paper packet and was precisely meters or approximately feet long the length was sufficient for me to plug in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passengers seat tangle free flexibility strength standards am not particularly fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire circular shape when bunched actual product the cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility reasonable thickness sturdy intermediate cable the whole construction of the cable due its cable size flexibility is almost tangle free the associated cable was not exactly thick but cant be termed as thin or delicate too its not the thickest ive seen but then thickest doesnt always means most durable given my application its more than just suitable the overall built quality of the cable insulation looks promising enough to last few years even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long had further shortlisted mansaa an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement compact moulded connectors had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal pcbs actual product there are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable the connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open the connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces the connector ports are sturdy enough both at usb micro ports the micro port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good no signs of loose construction being gold plated is more of misleading fancy term in this case as most of the metal ports designed today already have corrosion resistance nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways availability of ties velcro straps as per my intended use in car where compactness was of paramount importance expected an included cable tie or velcro strap would be nice add on to properly adjust arrange the cable as per requirement actual product this miss the most in the provided actual cable there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which could adjust my required cable length easily decent current handling capability on the newest qc certified chargers the current transmission can go up to amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have decent current handling ability actual product the actual cable has nameplate rating of handling up to amps against demands at new qc chargers that could go up to amps here let me clear out that the latest qc chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging thus it is not like continuous flow of amps is there it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for continuous current handling of anything above amps would sufficiently work with qc chargers have tried it safely multiple times charging my samsung from without the cable getting hot warranty comes with year warranty as expected not the best in the industry but reasonable other observations apart from the above listed features the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are the cable is manufactured in china imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name philosophy of amazonbasics the cable has manufacturing date of oct it was imported to india in dec the cable has mrp tag of bucks however purchased it online for bucks being prime member shipping was free customer care toll free number email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances final verdict it has been few days since have received been using this product so far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for price of around suppose its worth it will surely update if any malfunction is observed worth for buy the quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination simply superb goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition make in india is good but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in and without and make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers govt should infact encourage such competition amazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devices as an past customer of many cables from amazon this cable doesn also disappoint supports fast charging for all my samsung phones use samsung pro samsung plus which this cable is compatible with very sturdy thick and very long ft very affordable pricing thanks amazon also use usb cable for my samsung fe super product charging is ok however it mere foot in length the vendor could have mentioned correct product description there is no need to mislead too early to say performance as have received it today good have bought many cheap chinese micro usb cable in rs and rs of ubon and of many other chinese local companies and none of them worked properly finall decided to go for this and it is charging as well transferring data without any issue and am very happy with my purchase my advice dont buy cheap chinese local cables of you will have to throw them in dustbean after some time better buy this one,positive
about the tv wonderful probably the best tv in this price range inr good google interface loaded with features lightweight watt power consumption stable design average sound and picture quality is quite good but if you compare it with premium brands then obviously not that good features most of the streaming apps available and compatible you can connect with wi fi lan cable hdmi set top box laptop usb gaming console old dish cable and direct tv antenna as well built in chromecast to cast any compatible app directly from phone to tv over same wi fi network ways to connect phone via cast feature on mobile apps no password needed only need to be on the same wi fi network via chromecast app project only selected media pics videos or entire phone screen ways to connect pc laptop windows cast option project the entire laptop screen on tv using windows cast option need to be connected on same wi fi network via hdmi cable about the amazon installation service awful the technician brought cheap hanging hook that had mrp inr on it and asked for inr for it without any receipt he kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially however it clearly had mrp mentioned on it went to market and bought much better cabinet for just inr and for installation of that as well technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top he just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws which had bought with him after about half an hour of arguments he finally drilled the other required holes and for all this he kept cussing me that wasted his time there was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well this whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments this was the worst installation experience in my life so far bottomline please do not avail the so called free installation service from amazon it is just scam instead call the acer support they will do the job much better after using it for months here are it pros and cons pros great picture quality it awesome blacks are very good and is adjustable sound with db is very good looks great with thin besel remote comes with favorite ott buttons content upscaling is very good cons remote could have been better can use dth remote to turn on both televisison and set top box remote operation is bit complex motion technology not great there is noticeable blur when watching moving ballson ott but it decreases when you switch to dth overall it nice buy at this price point think am getting fairly better picture quality and sound am satisfied with the product product has good picture quality good product at that price with sound applications running smoothly months older no issues yet it running smoothly you get decent features for the price you pay screen resolution might be set back as you may find pixalation overall it good am amazed with the picture quality of this hd ready tv it is truly an amazing panel found it suitable for viewing distance of between to feet any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther it will feel like very small size the speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions however since the speaker is downward firing the experience will vary based on whether the tv is wall mounted or kept on stand the remote is good voice search works well for me tv start up takes long time in my opinion but have not compared it against any other inch tv and hence do not know where it stands among peers ghz wifi works very well even across walls only negative aspect faced is the experience of using my bluetooth headphones earphones firstly the connection sometimes doesn happen automatically after restart which means have to remove and re discover the device thru the menu which is not simple secondly the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at distance of feet in front of the tv the signal breaks even if you move your head by inches however am still super happy with this tv got it for during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side at this price range it is good quality product on this market acer only should work with sound quality improvement otherwise all ok picture quality really impressive wifi connectivity good easy to install boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is good sometimes lagging no major issues found on this tv just go for it vellu for money good product very nice product save money,positive

affordable available and multi purpose cable best suitable for traveling and reducing overall cables to carry warking fine build also good it is nice cable as it fits in most of the phones and devices sturdy one no fear of damage by wear and tear however felt that the cable is heated up substantially with higher currents this uncommon in standard phone cables provided by oems have been using this cable from last few months and very much satisfied with the this product and recommend to go for it the cable quality is very good charging time is good with availability of different cable types considering the price compared to competitors at market this is cheap but no compromises have been made with respect to sturdiness or quality the wires are wonderful despite using it for more over month now no issues at all were faced regarding wire tangling torn out wires etc very sturdy and pretty easy to carry regarding charging speed it delivers what it promised the quality of the ports are also solid no issue had been faced at all packaging was great performance of the product even greater the wires are long enough though in my personal opinion little bit more lengthy would be icing on the cake making the product absolutely perfect one overall very happy with purchasing it great vfm product for all those having multiple type devices with them this one single cable has solution to charging it all warp charge is working fine and satisfactory lightning cable is working in normal condition rather than fats charging but overall the product is awesome and felt value for money like,positive

after days uts tubes not working waste of money fuse early the item is nice light weight and good to use the only issue is crude finish the grill is coming off from sides the reflector surface is bulging out and appears that it may break with heat requested for replacement but mail sent to me says you will refund me the money after receiving the item this was not the arrangement kindly replace the item with one which is free of defects in cold conditions of hills in uttarakhand would like to use this item kindly give your views on my point so that am prepared to receive defect free item from you and return this one sleek body and the colour and only product of three rods with two year warranty light weight too and beautiful stand and can be rotated very good option in this range working efficiently and giving good temperature to my room one of my friend using this product for last years without any problem good point is that it does not gives any smell as other blower gives one suggestion increase power cord length by inches so that we can use any where item broken after some time customer care not picking the phone even single call was very useful in the record breaking winters this year you have up to levels of heating this is the best part the only thing is that the light gets too bright so as to hurt your eyes but this is the issue with all such heater,neutral
after going through many reviews and checking multiple brands decided to settle with philips ac not sure how accurate is the pmi number it is displaying but we can feel noticeable difference after using it for over month cleaning the filters also easy overall happy with the product highly recommend so much so that bought another one it been month and just had to wash the first filter once and works very nicely everyone in the house is breathing nicely and clearly monitors the pm level in the air exactly when installed it in the kitchen the pm level went up as soon as the cooking started and the purifier automatically switched to higher speed and brought it down during karthigy when everyone was cracking crackers the pm level went up in the purifier indicating increase in air pollutants great product no issues and work very efficiently easy to install no noise and air clean quickly did not receive an invoice and there is no serial number marked on the product am unable to initiate any request with the manufacturer it reduces pollution indoor but take time good purifier with almost no noise and good display of impurities in air,positive

after receipt of product received demo request and opted for demo code ref today contacted eureka forbes for the demo and understand there is no demo for vacuum cleaners from their end fyi please na good but complicated equipment blower function unable to use we didn receive stamped warrenty card with the product compact and good value for money but there was no demo from eureka forbes they did not bother to call us the pipe provided are of very low quality one of the pipe is already broken they have sent youtube link thats the great support we got from the manufacturer it is pleasure to clean without noise and stress this product from eureka forbes is very good it lives up the name eureka forbes have made in vaccum cleaner market good suction power easy power control cord length is also good with convenient button to roll it sufficient accessories which covers almost every area good filters works on normal sockets which isn the case in some high power vaccum cleaner demo for the product provided by ms priya was also good use of all the accessories was clearly explained and other necessary details to operate the product was clearly explained too overall am satisfied with the product and service provided till date,positive
after testing couple of times it seemed as if the fans didn impact the cooling experience as much as hope and most of the work was done by the stand raising the laptop itself this laptop fans started failing couple of months after purchase and now make quite an annoying noise hence referring my above statement if you experience this noise it would be best to just leave it turned off if you don care about the small additional cooling it do cooling but not that like was expecting quality is nice having fans two separate controls controls four fans nd control for middle fan so depending upon laptop battery cooling required power can be distributed built quality is good although it is very light weight design is superb having two usb ports so even one fails second would be avail which will increase life of this product its throwing really cool air through small honeycombs can feel with hands so its cooling my laptop really well just had small issue about fans that sometime if pad gets tilted before starting have to tap it lightly to start it may be its balancing issue but its not much problem for me as it occurs only sometimes it works very well all time so recommend everyone to buy good product like the product and the performance also but the cost is too high think they need to reduce the price according to the performance for office use it is good adjustable is slightly okay build quality and fan quality is good best for price rpmlooks good quality is also good not for heavy gaming am using it for video editing premier pro works fine but fan sound is high,positive
after using the phone for day feel corners have been cut in various areas jn sensor is not that great in low light color is typical samsung style with oversaturated greens interesting to note that jn is also being used in samsung new thermal management is very poor device heats up in normal usage within minutes if the screen brightness is high same is the case when camera app is opened simple games on flipkart gamezone are played there are reports on youtube of narzo camera shutting down on hot days above scenarios and hz adaptive refresh rate also drain battery like crazy speaker and earpiece do not have crispiness upper treble instead sound like white noise earpiece volume is low so is the speaker volume when on call on the other hand speaker volume is decent while playing back videos flashlight is half as bright as normal smartphones don really know if company did cost cutting here or its software bug no fm radio and secondary mic minor features missed if shifting from miui to realmeui the gallery app is not as good as miui one requiring more taps for basic opeeations like viewing whatsapp images folder mediocre ram management with realmeui android to be fair could not find any major bug in realmeui so far the lcd display is fantastic and very well calibrated with relatively cooler white point as opposed to yellowish super amoled there was no green or purple tint touch response was excellent screen protector case fast charger usb cable were present the phone feels much slimmer than my bulky due to its thin body gm less weight and sleek case camera app has full fledged manual mode something absent from samsung disclaimer above impression has been made after using smartphones over last years asus zenfone redmi redmi samsung strongly consider other current alternatives too like redmi note poco pro poco pro redmi note samsung samsung moto before buying narzo more info do not fall for bloatwares like glance when setting up the phone check as few check boxes as possible before blindly clicking agree turn off content recommendation by going to the settings additional settings get recommendations and switch the green toggle off to remove bloatwares that cannot be uninstalled usual way follow excellent guide by youtuber tech office mentioning all realme app names required for adb commands was able to uninstall hot apps games this way update detailed camera comparison between samsung and narzo samsung hdr algo seems more sophisticated narzo unnaturally brightens some shadows too much there is also some oversharpening both cameras choose cool auto white balance which results in bluer skies but lifeless greeneries even in golden hours however narzos colors become more hue accurate after choosing white point in expert mode whereas samsung still delivers bluish green foliage colors at cloudy white balance narzo strangely does some weak auto hdr even in expert mode but samsung fully turns it off in pro mode resulting unusable photos however when using night mode narzo photos appear more cleaner but less saturated at night gcam for narzo is not optimized properly and gives noisy night photos with greenish cast and crushed shadows much worse than realme night mode on the other hand thereas no gcam and no camera api support for at night you can take long exposure shots upto secs through expert mode by manually choosing shutter speed in narzo something you can do in this however requires tripod support and whenever done properly the results are very good you have manual film mode in narzo whereas you can even manually set white balance in video mode as samsung lower end galaxys don have pro video mode this mobile is suitable for every one it good but camara is average quality very good phone iam very happy with this while using thank you amaon had purchased this phone in and this phone is actually brilliant in this price range camera is good fingerprint sensor is good back panel is good purchased black one no hang but there is small problem that battery drains little faster and when you click home button google assistant appears most of the time which is quite annoying sometimes overall am happy with the phone wanted an affordable phone this fits the bill perfectly fantastic finger reader battery sustainability for long time usage and hd quality natural photographs awesome product at stunning price,positive

am not big on camera usage personally was even mentally prepared for bad camera based on some reviews here but was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos they are not awesome but they are decent photos that can even be shared now coming to my biggest grouse heating issue the phone started heating up while charging but it was just little and so could have ignored it but then it started heating up more and got me very concerned even ordered replacement thinking got defective piece but then after further tests found that it is heating more when download huge amounts of data for example when restore data of my old phone from back up this is ok with me as don perform huge data loads regularly definitely not on phone then tested by running tasks usually perform such as checking office mails attending office meeting on phone watching video from amazon prime and so on the phone did not heat up even little personally this is good for me at this price range this is good phone but if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently this phone may not for you am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you or not in terms of camera and heating had many questions about these aspects before buying perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy or avoid cheers display beauty camera decent performance amazing battery ok in mah expect more tbh overall good phone also after day of use found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim which using right now in this phone but ll keep update this review after month of usage it decent mobile under this price but few things worried me weight of the phone too many procedure to change some settings no screen casting apart from that it has good touch decent camera for day light battery life is good bought this smartphone for my mom samusung interface is very handful for easy use battery is superb last whole day camera is mediocre but provide original colour pictures all in all satisfied with this smartphone that got in sale for unable to do video call within same service provider as in volte within same service provider video call feature is available product is fine nothing fancy but for the budget it is good phone battery more than enough for normal use not sure in gaming camera good in this segment can record videos in fhd fps display since it lcd display the quality is bit less but good ram you can add upto gb of virtual ram but have to sacrifice your storage space to use it overall good budget phone finger print is working speedy battery backup is good camera quality is also good,positive
am not pro gamer play gta valo and cs go this mouse is enough for casual gaming and didn find any issues with it although after year something can hear the parts in side the mouse rattling but that could be because the mouse was dropped several times though the year maybe it well built so even the counterparts are moving the mouse still works good at this price nothing much to say sbout it it does the job and cable is strong enough decent buy if you want simple mouse with long enough cable the product built is quite good and hold is also nice must buy if you are looking for good mouse at this price standard mouse with good build quality can be used for both office and home basic purposes cheap in price great built quality smooth in use best over other mouses of this price segment and even better than costly mouses prefect product overall if you want good daily use mouse go for it over any mouse in the market can be used for normal purpose adequate length of the cable brand value comes with quality easy to use not suitable for gaming been using from while and its super comfortable,positive
am pleased with my purchase the installation process is easy and the product is very reliable the level safety feature ensures that the water heater is safe to use and prevents accidental scalding the water heater heats the water quickly and the temperature can be adjusted to suit my needs the only problem am facing is with the indicator ideally the red light shows that the water is getting heated and it turns off when the water is heated enough but in my unit it vice versa the green indicator is working as red and the red indicator is green it is worth buying it works well first of all packaging was poor secondly crompton says it is good for family of members bath bucket but for that waiting is too long go for higher rated geyser from crompton installation is not hard instruction book is given only lacking point is warranty card is sign seal warranty card is valueless works just fine but must say it is useful more for kitchen purpose and in bathroom if don use shower cuz after running for couple of seconds the temp of the water drops heating is not that effective being instant if anyone wants to take hot shower must go of geysers with larger storage capacity the packaging was good and intact no connecting pipes were inside the power cable was very short that made things bit difficult bought lengthy connecting hose for cold and hot water supply installed it myself and registered online on crompton site if you have drill machine or if you can borrow it it just takes two holes to complete the installation working well and makes hot water in mins do not connect using any extension box unless it is rated for otherwise the wires will melt better always try to connect directly with the socket very useful product,positive
am posting this after few weeks of using the product usage continuous ott only no cable dish operator average daily usage hours the tv is great value for money product installation the installation was simple and amazon assisted installation was smooth timely and hassle free picture the picture quality is not great when compared with the smoothness of sony lg and samsung with these kind of specs movies and especially hi res tv series experience was somewhat diluted as most of the times the output while in hi res wouldn look like movie quality which we are used to of watching in the likes of sony samsung lg etc however with time you get used to it and only realize the difference when you see the same movie at someone else better tv sound sound output is decent you wouldn need additional support to enhance the volume as such remote sleek sensitive and user friendly it exactly like amazon remote os same as any smart android tv works smoothly without much lags or hiccups switching apps from one to another takes couple of seconds more than sony but unless you have used to of those performances it looks just fine standalone and as your first smart tv you wouldn find any reasons to not like the quality and it would like hi res from the beginning it is great value for money product without doubt however if you are considering this as an alternative or second tv after owning the better ones in the past you will have hard time adjusting with it picture quality is good for this price didnt faced any lag on ui and browsing other apps only negative will be audio definitely need sound bar if are frequent movie watcher overall worth for money spend but the installation process is just awful amazon claiming that trained professional will visit for installation but neither they are trained nor professionals just read the installation manuals and installed the wall mount which took hours for them to buy the wall mount after charging money no demo given on tv as they have no idea about the product these things making to think twice or thrice to buy tv through online screen looks amazing but problem is with processor believe if content is getting streamed on device then we can observe the green screen flickers not so often but problem exists even remote control is not good as it take at least sec to react for the user action reason why believe processor is bad because do gaming using ps and never encountered problem with the screen if you buy tv in small town shop it will be delivered and installed immediately within couple of hours when you want to buy tv from amazon you need to wait for it to be delivered for couple of days and it is understandable the problem is with the installation they take so much time to install that you end up regretting buying the product its like you are hungry and food is in front of you but you cant eat so ordered my tv on monday it got delivered on friday and it will be installed on monday because of weekend where as there is no concept of weekend in small towns if we had the technician details we could reach out get it installed but that also will be shared hours before regarding product its good quality and very good for average user heavy duty like games and continuous usage on some store will be challenging guess this tv gives good results within the budget should definitely buy if the budget is but most important point like to mention is after sales service and also the installation part the installation guy didnt arrive at very first day that was scheduled even after rescheduling he didnt came for installation purpose so strictly be aware of this point the tv got in offer with discount on icici card but although the product came out defective it had dead pixel on the display which is very bad after period of time even after the fault was from seller as it was defective piece didnt got the replacement for the product and its totally unfair deal by amazon and the seller too final verdict is the tv quality and feature are good but the service from seller and amazon that is got was very poor inspite was prime member the seller dawntech electronics private limited gives very poor service and feel bad that in such cases amazon will not help you thankyou team also to be added tv installation services with product while delivering and unboxing no need to other sub vendor to getting installation and demo also dependency on third party involvement should be less bad experience with tv installation stuff pls look into this picture quality good sound quality not upto my xpectations not able to find the real dolby stereo effect remote not upto the mark for picture quality for both sound and remote quality good quality picture but it hangs on home screen,positive

am using it for days now the experience is pretty good as of now picture quality is also not bad don expect something out of the world at this price point but you can go for it if you have tight budget initial impressions works as said glad didnt go for cheaper options not that its too costly just plug and play will update if it screws up the hdmi cable is good to watch movie sports and its gives better quality while connecting your laptop with tv and play loved it works as expected length of the cable is short and it was mentioned also satisfied my requirement if you need more length better look other options all good it the best hdmi cable at this price range no problems yet just go for it was expecting this to be delivered on time and it was delivered on time product is good as have tried other cables and wires from amazon basica brand good one,positive

am using this on an old mac mini since the broadcom proprietary drivers aren available and the replacement drivers don allow for sufficient download speeds at least in my experience got this device up and running with ubuntu with linux generic google search for morrownr au and use the driver on github using the product tp link ac btw if you are using the other variant sold on amazon use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for giyf will admit this is probably going to be hard for someone who is not generally comfortable with shell bash for example but even though had never used dkms or iw before the github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working read the git hub readme to be sure first got the drivers working in local ubuntu vm using guest additions to connect to the usb device directly from the guest os which also worked ultimately installed the os on the host and setup the drivers using usb tethering then got the same download speed using this device was previously getting on my other network interfaces on windows and mac but now on ubuntu the device itself is bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed have been using for about month now without complaints do not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali me and some of my friends all are using it for wi fi hacking and it works really well it also supports monitor mode if you are having issues in connecting it to your kali machine then just go through the web surf bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this tp link adapter to your kali machine there is also driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machine have given it stars just because the performance if not good as the alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as beginner it is the best adapter you can buy nice product working fine my pc is now price is too high so giving star got the wi fi in one of the rooms from to has been working well since month now good alternative to repeater if only single device needs to access the wi fi from corner the product is very nice and have good wifi signal using this for over month now no complain but when it for the first time you need to install the driver on your desktop laptop from the tp link website to make it operational which is not very well explained in the manual this product is very good have buy this product because my laptop dont support wifi ghz band in ghz receive mbps speed only but my broadband plan is mbps easy to use plug and play windows good signal am using another room from router no signal drop receive full signal little bit expensive but go with this because of good signal receive mbps download and mbps upload speed on ghz and my broadband plan is mbps highly recommend this product purchase this product for company use and this is very good product,positive
am using this product from last days and its working great keyboard keys are really soft touch and almost soundless it automatically goes in power saving mode with in sec when not in use mouse works smooth works almost on every surface fast typers can also use this product yes just that the material plastic of the keyboard is expected within this price this model companion keyboard buttons are not as comparable comfortable as other standard basic model available however we need to practice to get used to it overall it is ok for rough use where we can avoid using laptop keyboard keyboard requires aaa battery and mouse require aa battery it could have maintained same need to check battery life of keyboard mouse doesn come with on off button to save battery life good for the space using it good one of the key came out then ve to replace now working well but not dependable bcos if not careful when the next one comes out can say then it useless keyboard is excelent but mouse quality is below average but at that price perfect choice good ok very good product,neutral
am very happy after using it this power bank is very good have seen video on you tube with an amazing rating before buying it enjoyed buying it good product value for money esme ek choti torch jaisi light add karke thoda price badha den to mast raho over all great product but have faced problem while charging the power bank with my mi charger it never accept quick charge and sometimes takes more than hours to charge while with macbook pro charger it accepts quick charge that green light bought separate charger for this power bank good like it power bank is good the only issue was the cable which came with it broke after day of use and also damaged power port of phone just good as expected compact size came with premium good packing need see how it performance with mah can charge devices at time but good for single charge of mah mobile they have given one usb type to type cable if you have another type cable with that can charge another device like the carrying pouch they provided didnt got any pouch with this power bank,positive
am writing this review after months the first cable had cut and had to be replaced the second cable is working fine no issues using it to charge me ps controller works fine at good price planning to pick up another one as spare product ok bought this cable to charge my bluetooth speaker and its working as expected it lengthy and usable for car dashcam quality is average and micro type end does sit very tight otherwise it all good but keep checking price of amazon basics cable of this type price drops many times that better quality this is one of the good product in this price range quality is okay using it for my laptop cooling pad overall build looks sturdy but longevity cannot confirm also you cannot connect pcs using male to male usb that is not how it works stop writing negative reviews after using this cable for something that it was not intended for can confirm that it is as most other products and not as the seller claims both in title and on stickers on the product no review mentions this but needed length for perfect use so disappointed as have to rotate the cooling pad and use it cable falls short by around cm it works well the cable is soft and flexible in all probability it will last long also but pover quality,positive
am writting this after months usuage go for it as suction power is too good only cons is dust capacity is very limited as we need to clean frequently it too heavy to be handle and not good for deep cleaning tried to clean matresses and sofa but dusts were there too early to write the review but working good so far likes handy easy to use comparatively light cleans extremely well due to strong suction power looks good good clean design power cord is very long easy to store doesn take up much space dislikes heated up quite lot within minutes not even minutes after cleaning an upholstered stool and foot rug had to switch off and let it cool so obviously not something that can be used at stretch to clean all your upholstery etc like other more expensive vacuum cleaners no flexible hose with the more expensive version with extension stick when one has paid much more providing the small flexible hose which is meant for cleaning inaccessible areas like underneath sofas ceilings etc was something expected sure the hose itself is pretty inexpensive they could easily have provided it at no extra cost if one needs that hose one needs to buy the less expensive unit again just to get the hose as it not even available for sale separately manual is hopelessly inadequate had to look up you tube videos no soft brush provided for cleaning the filter does not come in amazon packaging even though it fulfilled by amazon it just the agaro box think is closed by openable flaps not even sealed so we cannot be sure if it returned defective product or brand new one no quality check sticker or anything assuring that the product has been checked before packing on you tube video there was sticker at the joint of dust connector and main body on mine there is no sticker just slight sticky residue so it been removed by someone not sure if it returned product again as there is no seals on the box don want to return this as already had returned one box that was filthy with oil stains and had opened from the bottom flaps had come apart none of the attachments etc were sealed in their plastic cover packets quite loud reading the reviews thought it would be less noisy but it not no blower function other brands in this range have would have been great to have this only attachments floor carpet brush multipurpose brush crevice nozzle other brands in this range have many more an extra filter would have been good gesture to include not very light if one wants to clean high surfaces like sides of ceiling or ceiling fans etc one needs to lift it and hold in hand while cleaning very difficult to do especially for ladies or at least me middle aged lady again here the flexible hose if provided would have been handy someone could hold the vacuum cleaner while using the hose to clean high areas all in all reasonably happy with this purchase as it is supplementary one to my existing year old eureka forbes vacuum cleaner which is still going strong as the upholstery cleaning attachments for that model got lost do feel strongly though that the price could have been reduced considering all the above pros and cons compact size it is light duty light usage and limited application area equipment not for effective complete usage its good vaccum good suction and easy to clean up however the suction sound is quite loud nevertheless its good machine does the job well the product works well it just heats up after using for mins,positive
amazing product very useful too good product good value for money bought it for rs if height was more would be great it heavy and stable good product but can change as given in photo because space is very low near base loved the build quality of this stand at this price point the stability is pretty good and it holds my phone even with thick case properly there is only one downside while connecting the charging cable with your phone in portrait mode the cable bends sharply as the stand is quite low but place it on the box the stand came in and it works for me so no problem for me at all value for money product quality if the product is very good it been while since using this sturdy too totally worth the money ok good,positive

amazon delivery is super am used one month two lights are gone product is good and easy to use only issue is tubes is very bright and stand is poor quality box is showing to but it is all steps showing only how it is belive product how to buy separate lights don buy any maharaja whiteline product have bye this room heater on january and in december one rod has stopped have complaint to maharaja customer care they refused to change the rod free of cost they are saying that rod is not under warranty only box is under warranty maharaja is cheater company the concern first base of the heater is made of plastic and plastic base needs to be screwed with the metallic heater body with screws since heater body is metallic tall and has weight the connection with plastic base doesn feel robust durable enough as it shakes when touched else all looks good and rest depends on how long it lasts the stand needs to be more sturdy as it leans back on flat surface otherwise this is good product for ft room,neutral
amazon delivery was prompt and on time received next day off ordering not even hr star for amazon and delivery product packing was very good guys product is good but you need to find your own ways to instalation for installation we had to call the customer service of crompton where in they registered the request and they provide the third party installation team number for the specific area where in we have to call for installation they picked up the call registered the installation request and updated us they will call us back in minutes to confirm the installation time but there was no call back for two days and when we called back many times they don even bother to pick up the call but they were promptly disconnecting the call company needs to check the credibility of service provider and take appropriate action otherwise brand popularity will go for toss hope company takes appropriate action pathetic installation service from crompton had to call them multiple times before assigning mechanic the mechanic who came had knowledge about installation or the machine worried what they would provide in case of breakdown or machine malfunction would suggest users to think about the cons before purchase product is average nothing too exceptional to write about will suit you good enough not excellent is good to use but what observed is that its heats the water at only not more than its not that hot to mix but its good if heat and ready to bath it takes around min to heat good to bath in winter invoice should have been given inside the cartoon for problem in future if any with the geyser takes more time to get hot water good performance good product fast heating that was good,positive
amazon should provide mtr cable length very good quality nice item received in good packaging the cables is perfectly working and there is no color difference with it it works perfectly with gtx super asus tuf and dell with single desktop across dual monitor setup multi stream the trick to figuring out is how the cable fits your dp port both sides this fit in snugly with gtx and knew this is gonna work no need to do any voodoo with pulling cables powering off this and that to make dp cable work just works straight out of the box strangely this cable didn support my logitech wireless gaming mouse lightspeed connection the dongle is attached to the st of the two dell monitors mouse works when am viewing over type pd display with my laptops otherwise audio video resolution refresh rates didn bother durability could be question let wait and observe over the days lot have commented that this cable didn last long best in the budget this is not vesa certified cable sometimes the monitor goes black for to second the product is good its been almost week am using this cable am using lg gm monitor hz as soon as installed this cable the display went on default refresh rate hz then went into windows display settings as nvidia settings didn have refresh rate more than hz to change the refresh rate to hz and it switched without any issues avoid jerks to the monitor as figured the display goes off for brief or secs post jerking rest the cable quality is good however locks to the display ports could be appreciated rest all is fine hope this review might be helpful thank you,positive
an easy to use coffee filter at reasonable price value for money fit and finish is good good for glasses of filter coffee am relishing the original filter coffee taste in north india give it stars as it is the same as shown and good and easy to use mostly have instant coffee but this time bought some filter coffee from araku valley during my visit was not aware of the process that you can have it like the normal coffee so tried it like normal one and it failed miserably because the coffee seeds won get dissolved there is no coffee smell in it then went online to understand the process where came to know about this coffee maker bought it for cup coffee which cost me you can get bigger one also for or cup you can go through the process of how to make south indian filter coffee online to me it does job very efficiently and finally am able to have good cup of filter coffee now about the product it not premium quality steel but it decent one and it very easy to use you fill the filter in morning and you can have the raw extract till night so to me it value for money if you want to try filter coffee the press doesn work perfectly but does the job size is small you can only make one cup the steel quality is world class gives proper filteration,positive

apart from it leaving watermark on table it been good experience good product but one issue found that the head from where cool mist air comes should be flexible to rotate to any direction now suppose you are keeping in table and sitting on chair then all cool mist will go above instead of coming to you my sleep quality improved by this product and it gives the feeling of freshness operating manual inadequately written the nd diagram is not labeled water filling method not mentioned most importantly the cord length is too small why being so thrifty most switch boards are at about ft height cord does not support this height as said can be great product nice product the quality of the product is normal very thin plastic refilling water is tricky job as we have to fill it up side down the instructions are not clear if the product is tilted little it behaves differently the led lights are delicate and think loose as well its an awesome product humidifier helped my baby to sleep better due to nasal congestion so relieved as mother,positive

as browsed various multiple earphones in this range on not so busy workday break came across this very feature packed product it seemed interesting and had something called dirac opteo in it anc so thought give it shot first day impressions it blown me away exhaustive list of impressions dirac opteo balanced sound with punchy bass yeah and not booming bass it so great and quite surprised it sounds like something you expect at higher price point soundstage as soon as the headphone is switched on it starts in battery saving mode once you turn on dirac opteo mode you can literally feel the space opening up all the instruments feel individual and sound separated fireflies by owl city sounds lovely and all the strings sway in the centre while the various zaps and buzzes surround you it really great for the price treble and mids clean and clear the bass doesn overpower them and feels just right the vocals come out clearly and all the instruments don interfere with it drive home by steven wilson sounds great bass punchy and tight love how it fizzles in bonfire by knife party and how it reverberates in turn down for what by dj snake breakin sweat by skrillex zedd sounded tight and discovered how well produced it is lovers of tight bass this is your product volume it gets really loud so loud that can listen to it at the highest setting but if that your thing then you should know that the highs get pretty shrill at the setting but the bass is still pretty clean and loud anc anc is present but won drown everything out it great add on but if you re looking for headphone to make all sounds around you zero then this won do that if you need to drown out some noise while you listen to your tunes this will do the trick ambient sound mode the opposite of anc it pulls in the outside noise to let you have conversation again you can blast tunes at high volume and still have convo but you can listen with lower volume near volume and hear things around you if the ambient sound also increased as increased volume it would have been amazing calling did couple of calls with no noise the other person said sounded great took couple of calls in local grocery store was pretty loud and the other end had no issue hearing me buttons the button placement is easy and didn feel any issue getting used to the controls the simple manual explains everything in mins so read once and you re good to go to note the sound is best in dirac opteo mode every time you turn it on you have to double press the multi function button to turn it on have loved having it on by default also every time turn it on it plays second tune which could have been shorter imagine hearing it every time you turn the thing on ugh connectivity once connected it to my phone the first time it connects to my phone within seconds of turning the earphones on battery it seems to last long ve been using them for about hrs and it gone down about cannot say anything more yet though when you take both the earphones out of your ears it doesn auto pause like some of the competitors annoyed that this was missed would have saved so much more battery if they did this build quality have black version it made with good quality plastic and didn feel heavy around my neck it doesn have metal anywhere and it quite simple think it looks decent exercise need to test will update later in summary an easy recommendation if you can overlook the small issues there great sounding feature packed and long lasting device here at great price would definetely recommend first was bit sceptical about the build quality but have to say it got pretty sturdy material and decent quality buttons bass is good vocals are much clearer in crystal bionic mode anc is working to degree will definitely cancel out the noise of your celing fan but don except any more than that no issues with call enx is working upto it name battery is sufficient around hours if you mix up the modes overall decent all rounded neckband jack of all and king of none all other things such as sound quality battery backup are very good but multiple device pairing is implemented very poorly if connect with laptop and try to connect with phone at same time it does not work many times if headphones are connected to laptop and you close the laptop without shutting it down then you won be able to connect with phone again unless and until you disconnect with laptop this is big bug please fix this this bo at anc neckband is very good but needs improvement and fixes pros nice sound quality while using crystal bionic sound but it average on normal mode which feels little more bassy and losses clarity at certain points great build quality it anc ambience mode is good in this price range it quite comfortable to wear for long sessions as per my ear fitting it has dual pairing which is very good but it not very seamless and there is small issue with dual pairing while receiving call on one device the audio video being played at another device won pause you have to manually pause instead there won be any sound output through that device its little issue but it would have been great if the video gets paused while receiving call on another device as this is available on bo at rockerz and few different bo at neckbands cons it range is very low considering bluetooth even have bo at neckband with which has better range even single wall coming in between ms can block the sound output its battery life is average which needs charge every day if you use it for roughly hours everyday with bionic crystal mode anc enabled while using dual pairing sometimes there are sound drops and lags in between and the sound gets high pitched and starts lagging sometimes if you switch quickly between devices this happened on the replacement unit received maybe it not the case with your unit sometimes no sound is received while playing audio from both devices don know if it wrong with my unit or every unit overall this is good and considerable neckband under if you want good bass rich sound quality anc ambience mode and descent battery life but if your requirements mostly is dual pairing then this is not for you as bought this considering dual pairing feature most importantly but it not really seamless in between devices but still it the best possible available feature in this price range or even under but it needs improvements and fixes to make it more seamless and efficient another problem with dual pairing is that the media doesn gets paused on first device if there call on the second one which is already there on bo at few other neckbands but then there is no media pause feature on them if audio is being played on devices first device audio will get paused if audio is played on second device and vice versa so do try it out by yourself because it my personal experience with the neckband maybe you get better experience thanks for reading happy shopping bought this one after using rockerz pro for over years now comparing this with that that one was ergonomically better felt snug in ears standalone review of this noise cancellation is just alright not too great not too bad sound quality is definitely great and excellent with the bionic sound feature kudos on that part bass quality is fairly good at this price point holds charge for as long as advertised overall bulky nature of the neckband puts you off and then the finish is poor too around the control buttons making it look very tacky cheap atleast on the funky grey one which bought because it was priced lowest conclusion good product at fair price nothing too great but nothing bad either,positive
as connector it does its job fine package arrived on time working good value for money good buy great value although the wire came folded and had to untie it and untangle it it does the job well and for the price it at couldn ask more nice product with good quality using this since long time and this never disappoint me must buy and good plastic quality value for money,positive

as per expectations at this price point guide stickers should be provided installation without those guide stickers is challenging for lay person ended up having to lift up the sticker several times to realign in and this resulted in imperfections in few places and so now there are bubles that can do anything about suits correctly good quality for money ok liked the product and packaging was very impressive quality wise and usage wise the glass is fine but the alignments are not proper for my tablet in samsung galaxy tab the glass alignment centering nearby the front camera is not proper refer to my pictures uploaded rest is fine perfect fi no bubble or smudge but the price is bit on higher side otherwise ok good,positive
at rs it great deal use it for mobile vlogging noice cancellation is not working value of money good mike worth money very nice mic in this price range after seeing many microphone found this bought it becuase of its good ratings and reviews and in buget price this is best for beginners the first time had ordered this mic received in amazon plastic bag and the product box inside was completely damaged and was sealed using cello tape also the mic seller sent me was damaged and had low quality audio it was duplicate but when replaced received the packing in cardboard box but still the inner box had few damages the mix received inside was good here is detailed review of the mic the quality quality overall nice the wire might seem filthy and weak but in reality when tested it it was indeed bit durable it can easily sustain bit of pull and twist just mind the spots when the wire meets the audio jack and the mic sound quality sound quality is really nice but but but before you think of buying it read the paragraph below of noise cancellation the mic catches sound equally even if you are from far away or close to it noise cancellation this is major point used to mic lot for testing purposes let me share my experience tested it in different environments in closed room with ac and total silence in such environment you will get crisp sound like boom microphone but you will also receive bit of white noise or background static noise which you can easily reduce using the noise reduction feature in room with ceiling fan on and moderate noise still seems good but not great your vocals would still be crispy and clear but the background noise will increase still if you use nice noise reduction software like audacity it will sound great adding background music to your video would help in room with standing fan on and high noise not recommended at all not only this mic but any mic would capture ton of noise to express statistically there will be atleast noise of wind whooshing in the background the same high noise room with windows open you will die doing noise reduction not gonna lie the background noise increases by times dont try this the pop filter or the sponge on the top of the mic helps lot when you are speaking close to the mic lot of air goes in while speaking so when the filter is attached the output sound does not have air whooshing but with the filter removed the output sound is only air now to sum up mic is overall good noise cancellation is not great but yeah for the price range it is the best recording tips record in silent room with or else turn on the fan at the least speed so it doesn make much noise use the collar clip to place the mic don hold it in hand mean this is common sense if transmission lines electricity wires which are above the head go from close to your room would recommend changing rooms now the reason for this is that sometimes the mic can catch electromagnetic intefrerence this maono mic won catch it but recommend this for generic mics do noise reduction in audacity it is very effective than the inbuilt noise reduction tools in video editors also it is very easy also boya by mic sounds almost the same as this mic there is only like difference in noise cancellation but would still give both of them stars for noise cancellation that it hope you understand what mean to say peace out nice,neutral
at the sub inr price range was doubtful to buy mechanical keyboard as there are lot of disappointing pseudo mechanical keyboards available at this range already had logitech prodigy which was great with it membrane so almost thought of not buying it but after much thought bought it it turns out to be amazing it has key cap remover included which is great bonus each click feels responsive and great am typing wpm with this compared to my the size is bit small for full sized keyboard and the rgb is somewhat painful but other than that it is the best keyboard in this price range good keyboard for people who loves typing sound nice product very good build quality price of rs is justified and have written the review using the same key board best budget friendly very good keyboard to begin your mechanical keyboard journey with this is much better than any membrane keyboard you will ever use been using for more than year and still working fine although the blue switches slowly lose their crisp sound but that is expected from this brand of switches value for money wish could coustomise to colour of rgb but rest it very good very good product and perfectly working well hello guys today am going to tell you about hp gk gaming keyboard so it cost me around and give the ratings from star will give it three star because it have some rgb issues and recommend you only buy this keyboard if you get it under if it cost over recommend that don buy this keyboard,positive
atlast connected successfully working good but sound volume clarity not adequate durability to be assessed dear amazon in tell the seller to write connecting procedure clearly manual printing also is bad had to struggle does what it says works well to connect two bluetooth devices to any other device like laptop smart tv etc can take bit of time to pair two devices but the manual in the box helps sound quality over aux cable too is good so even if you do not have digital output or rca you can still use it bit bit flimsy and delicate but then you don need to move it around everyday disadvantage the sound and video lag with distance while connecting bluetooth with headphones pairing with headphones difficult need to wait long feels volumes low got this to add on to high end system which traditionally doesn have the facility however it often requested when guests come over was using phoenix transreceiver but the constant need of charging and the single indicator led made it difficult to integrate into this kind of application the optical out is connected to dual ess dac and the device used for transmission is the pad air this lacks battery which is big differentiator this means it is not exactly portable and the form factor reinforces that feature it is intended to be desktop unit and it comes with reasonable set of cables the quality of the included cables is quite poor so it best to use something else compared to the direct input from usb the overall sound is poorer with shrunken soundstage and coarse vocals and treble still this is being used in high end system suspect with many lesser speaker amp dacs it will be acceptable at maximum output the level is about lower than direct usb connection to the dac it is around the same as my signature acoustics unit which is rd the size but uses battery and doesn have volume control or the bypass feature or the nice display which is handy if you are close by the bypass is one of the highlights of this device it basically connects the two optical ports together in passthrough and allows you to use both bt and another optical source receiver though only either can be used at time the build quality is average it is lightweight enough that set of decent cables will tip it over backwards hence the thin cables supplied the onboard volume control is nice if bit redundant given everybody uses their handheld or other device to control volume use the dac remote it also has only clicks so the control will be very coarse the display has no spelling errors and while the resolution is low it is sufficient for the tasks overall it quite expensive but is more kitted out than similar devices the sound quality limitations of bt transmission compulsory resampling and lossy compression among others cannot be overcome even with the fanciest devices and protocols so rank it close to the top of what you can get as an add on for hifi system for more normal usage there are cheaper options available excellent product bluetooth range is very less bought it to connect my old sony blueray home theater with mi box which does not have optical sound port it has an spdif optical port which can connect to the home theater optical in,positive
audio contains lots of distortion when using speaker battery life is good bought this phone for my staff who can handle only these basic variety types she is very happy and loves the color nice one hgh battery backup is great didn like center button design separate four buttons would fit great rather than one square one irony is that it is for indian customers but couldn find gujarati language in this phone overall product is good for normal usage bluetooth radio camera memory card dual sim games are added features for fun good product it amazing and worth the cost the only weak point is that the response from the phone is little late after pressing buttons otherwise it best under this range nice one easy use and more flexible one easy to carry good battery life and camera quality also good not bad sound quality is good over all value for money,neutral
audio quality is good for this price range the noise cancellation also works pretty well best thing is that it fits well in my ears the functionality of microphone is also good because it reduces the unwanted environmental noise for eg when you are talking to someone in crowded place one tap left right pause play double tap left right previous next three tap left right volume four tap left music game four tap right base rock hi fi right hold change anc no anc transparent left hold bixby siri google assistant hold for longer time turn off these are the touch controls for omega anc is not that much good but okay gives good backup for price range of it is good enc is okay no app or anything to equalize have to do it with built in mobile equalizer noice cancellation is not good it lower quality system otherwise sound quality is good bass is ok looking very nice good fittings touch sensor almost good work it good set overall sometimes it doesn auto connect and need to open bluetooth settings in my phone laptops to manually connect which is little annoying for me other then latency it is not good for gaming environment sound is not good you cannot tell the direction of foot steps until it too close don buy it for gaming other than gaming it good earphone in this price range good product decent sound bass should have been better treble is slightly on the higher note anc works well and subdue ambient noise liked it good,neutral
average product as per use its costly this product is only for lint it is not effective to remove pet hair from clothes the roll has different layers don know what to do after this roll layers completed useful but would have preferred more adhesive power got at cheap price in sale it removed all dust and threads get stuck on my clothes after wash this is the best product when was ordering this was confused about quality because it was chep in price but once have used the same it wonderful work fast because of bigger in size highly recommend bad product product is of no use,neutral
average products this isnt useful for smoothies good for lassi or cold coffee that too was leaking nice for light fruits not continue works overall good but can blend only softer food or fruits am using this blender for weeks and now must say it worth you money go for it am college student and usually make oat banana milk shake for breakfast which to my surprise it did really good job in blending them battery full charge will give you blends build quality really good so just don think it perfect for college students go for it product is not good it very very worest item banana also not griding atleast nd charging issues battery is completed min and it will stops automatically,neutral

bahut aacha hai ye pen sach me likhne ke baad erase ho jata hai so nice had bought of these and they are excellent pens for the price but even after waiting for the ink to dry so can erase the ink properly it still left stain and also after keeping my notebook at room temperature it started show the ink in light blue colour which was not very noticeable hence am giving this product stars also like collecting lot of stationery from japanese manufacturers and this was not as good as expected so would rather buy uni ball air or signo or sarasa not expecting so much compromise from brand like pilot whose sign is placed at the same price and definitely did not have any quality compromise whatsoever anyway if you want starter pen take the or something my current go to pen highly recommend if you re someone who happens to do lot of scribbling while writing an exam paper really great for annotating stuff which you can erase and correct as and when needed the pen really erases but the ink finshed just in week so not to use this pen if you are student like me you need to apply more force and move your hand fast to erase what you wrote it very nice pen writes very smooth comparable to pentel energel gel pen grip is comfy it has nice click sound when retracted the eraser part gets dirty with oils dirt sometimes which when erasing with leaves faint brown stain due to the oil dirt just wipe it with some cloth like your shirt and you ll be fine wish refills were easily accessible though best for neat homework if your kid makes lot of spelling mistakes slightly expensive occasionally found dry ink easy to use write only on paper not elsewhere value for money,positive
bahut hi achha product hai badhiya saund and bluetooth connectivity build material is plastic body however sound was good nice sound quality is good battery performance good it is satisfactory bluetooth speaker and is perfect choice for those who are looking for budget wireless speaker for their laptop or mobile phone with low volume issues or for those who need some portable music device and who dont want to shell out lot of money it serves these purpose very well and is not pricey why am saying all this first things first got this at the black one only as rest of the colors were way too pricey and choice of colors can be sacrificed in such case my laptop and phone volume is too low and watching video or listening to music on these devices is not good experience so here too this speaker served the purpose as connectivity is excellent size of speaker is conveniently small lightweight and battery backup is damm awesome after complete charge used this speaker for continuously for about hours at about volume and still the speaker is left with charge cannot comment right now for the charging time as it arrived with more than charge and just topped it to full bluetooth connectivity is exceptionally good upto mtrs fm reception is average without connecting the data charging cable but it is awesome if the cable is connected it has only four buttons and all the functions are controlled by these buttons only first button is mode which when pressed switches from bluetooth to fm to aux to usb memory card transition of switching is flawless volume up down keys are used to change volume and switch the channels long press changes the volume and short press click changes the channels in fm or changes the track via aux most usefull feature of this speaker is its mic yes you can actually use this speaker when connected to phone to talk with someone and that too with no connectivity issues voice clarity is very good for the calls made music clarity is not very good read cons for this quality of the plastics used seems good and feels durable cons sound quality is just average voice call clarity is very good where music is not dominant but when it comes to music this speaker struggles to deliver quality people are complaining in reviews that it doesnot produce any bass but actually its is the bass produced by the speaker which deteriorates the quality this is understandable for this product as it just has one tiny speaker inside and if manufacturer makes it to produce some bass will definitely deteriorate the music quality but this is manageable and you can adjust the music equalizers in your laptop or phone to get pretty decent music quality this is the reason dont consider its music quality con for the product theres one limitation about charging connector to it comes with charging port compatible to type connector so if you have charger with data cable supporting type connectors you are bound to use the charging cable supplied with speaker only so you cannot keep just one common cable with you to charge both your phone and speaker instead you will have to carry two different cables this speaker does not come with charger so you will have to use your mobiles charger for the purpose but for the price rage this seems reasonable useful tip for buyers most of the smart phones will display battery percentage left in the speaker but you can install any of these two apps bluebatt or bluetooth check ringtone and show battery level from the playstore if in case your phone is unable to fetch battery data from speaker what you get in complete package unit of bluetooth speaker cable which has aux connector usb connector and type micro usb connector tiny user manual quality of packaging excellent sturdy packaging used by cloudtail to secure the companys product packaging manufacturing date was of may like it portability and bluetooth connection is good awesome,neutral

batteries does not charge as per the description have charge for more than hrs for full recharge to be used properly after the hrs charges the charging does not last for more than days with out use noticed when got the batteries that they are so much lighter than normal batteries and was suspicious but after using it heavily this battery runs out so much quicker than my other ah battery then saw the back of the case and it was written there it is ah battery everything else works fine as intended but don think they should be deceiving customers by giving another product and advertising something else that is fraud behavior but for price of it is justified getting overheated when charging is on for hour fear of getting melted the body good mid speed charger am impressed no chinese goods are my favourite like the product am using this for keyboard charging the battery in hours time to hrs good to have one am using this charger to charge my existing rechargable batteries both aa and aaa,neutral

below is the experience so far received defective product battery was getting drained out in few hours wifi kept getting disconnected and almost every app was giving trouble including google maps location was not getting captured tried to return it on the th day of purchase after running into issues with every app open tried on th night as well but phone froze and was not able to even switch off and restart the mobile amazon app was in this phone used another phone to check how to force reboot next morning and switched on the mobile amazon said return window is closed on th night and now need to call samsung customer care directly for replacement called samsung customer care and they tried to check the phone remotely couldnt identify the issue informed will have to visit the samsung service center to figure out the issue first visit to center they did software update week old phone now not sure what update would be pending and returned the phone saying we will see if issue persist for one more week they also whipped out the entire apps in the phone faced issues the very same evening lived with it for one more day and went back next morning second visit they identified that both motherboard and battery had manufacturing defect and will have to be replaced requested for phone replacement and they told me their policy doesn allow them to replace the device and can only replace the mother board and battery which was defective they told me will have to contact samsung customer case number again if want product replacement as they don have the authority for that called customer care number again and they inform me have to contact amazon for product replacement as amazon was the seller so back to step will have to see how many more hoops need to be jumped to reach the end if manage to reach there update all customer care said they can replace the phone so surrendered to defeat and gave the phone back to samsung customer care center for battery and mother board replacement they gave back the phone next day saying parts are replaced again whipped out of the apps which had downloaded and logged in again checked the phone from the center itself before taking it back and figured the problem still persist battery was draining out by the minute showed it to them they told me it new battery and will take some time to stabilize they also asked me to buy super fast charger while bought from them to not take chances they asked me to check for days and confirm used for days same situation no improvement went back to them again they checked and said they will forward it to technical team for checking now technical team checked the device and said there was software issue for few products in this version and then will need days to correct it since they are still working on the software update to correct this have no idea how this product passed the quality test if all these statements which they are making are true by this time samsung customer care has used the phone for more days than me since buying the device and they have identified hardware issue and software issue in the product but still refuse to give the money back and take back the product inspite of repeated requests they kept the phone for days and returned saying everything is fixed phone started functioning normally finally but was sick and tired of the experience called the samsung corporate customer care narating the the whole series of event and asking for refund they refused with all their might and said phone is working now during the process also figured out that the customer care center who kept the phone for days for repair dint even create registered complaint or job code while holding the phone for days officially registered complaint but still no luck of returning the phone update on nov th was traveling and outside the country on nov st while using the phone and with charge left screen went off and stared showing grid lines like some tv from tried switching of the mobile and restarting multiple times no luck still grid lines my flight bookings hotel bookings and everything one can think of was in the mobile and my month old phone is not responding to anything possible friend thankfully had spare mobile and used that phone till completed the trip reached back in town yesterday and my first act is to visit samsung customer care center nov th am writing this update sitting at the customer care center they mentioned patch issue software update dint happen at this point know they are just speaking rubbish to engage the customer and just delay the situation no month old phone screen will stop responding because of software update missing they are opening the phone again to operate it after again refusing my request for money refund its really good smartphone in its range packed with features and brand like samsung never fails to amuse with what they deliver at given price point still give it stars as battery could be better it also looses point for not including charger phone looks are good the charging speed is ultra slow even with the fast charger original also camera quality is not even like mp total lied about mp samsung ui is not very friendly and easy other brands have better and smoother ui phone is very sleek bought brown shade which looks much premium in hand at what it actually is good budget model phone you can not deny brand sumsung is brand overall good product for long use good worck charger should have been part of it but product looks good pricewise little overpriced some of the cons are little rigid fingerprint sensor after months of use frequently encounter lag when unlocking the phone battery life not up to the mark struggles to go the entire day even with regular use no mm jack and buggy bt pros very good camera excellent screen superb sound quality if you somehow get this for below then go for it or else there are better options available,neutral

best only issue is that you might misjudge its size it kind of too big especially if you re living in hostels like me using it for anything other than boiling water usually turns out to be pretty inconvenient for that reason even washing it at times but overall quality is really good it good product only suitable for specific use cases though good for homes the kettle is very handy to use and the capacity of it makes the work easier loved the new colour choices they are offering the size is sufficient and may be bit large for single person usage one suggestion is that temperature control knob could have been provided in this price range otherwise very good product finish is excellent takes little longer duration for boiling the problem is the outer of kettle which easily charms the dust smudge no matter whatever available kitchen cleaning products apply the blotch stains are signified to be permanent go for other than white colour very useful product and it is working good price is reasonable worth it like the metal base,positive

performance of this attachment blender can be used without the juicer sieve and works fine in wet blender flow breaker is provided sound sound is high but that is to be expected in powerful watt machine dos dont feel if we follow certain guidelines we can best out of the product do not overload do not use for more than minute without giving little rest when turning the speed knobs dont turn all at once from to max you will see that it works better if you turn knobs slowly staying at each speed for few seconds actually for most things low to medium speed is enough the machine is really powerful when grinding large amount of ingredients the jar can heat up not the machine so give little rest in between for wet grinding use cold water to grind that way the jar will never heat up do not grind hot ingredients many people have complained about the rubber gaskets melting that can only have happened if hot food are being blended or ground bring food to room temp and then grind wash the jar gasket jars immediately using sponge and liquid detergent so that the shine of the jar remains intact always remove and wash the gasket to avoid unhygienic conditions as food can get under the gaskets in the wet blender remove the flow breaker by sliding it off and wash it separately as food particles can get stuck behind it to remove fine particles when dry grinding dont use spoon to avoid scratches to the jar you can use your hand and brush used for this purpose only this is an expensive piece of equipment in my house only my husband use it we do not allow children or household help cooks to use it this way the machine will not be misused if you mixer does not work please check the overload protector button on the underside of the machine remove some of the ingredients and try again take care while handling jar lids and lid tops although they appear quite well made cannot say if they will break when dropped pros the machine is very powerful and delivers what it promises it is easy to use and gives truly hands free experience easy to clean grinds and blends everything leak proof lids takes very little time to grind the motor does not heat up even easily the overload protector works perfectly cons guarantee manual the manual has to be downloaded from the amazon website the amazon payment is the guarantee there is no separate guarantee card provided had to call amazon to understand the situation regarding the guarantee card delivery the mixer grinder came in box but there was no special styrofoam padding this was big minus for me couple of extra lid clasps should be provided one of my lid clasps was loose it is working fine at the moment but as backup company should provide these as the jars are pretty large for smaller amount of products it is little difficult wish the smallest chutney jar was usable for both dry wet grinding rather than only wet the jars do have screws heads on the inner side but this is not big deal and can be cleaned quite easily review after using for few months pros the lock feature is really good for hands free usage grinds very fast say half cup soaked urud dal can be ground to paste in less than minutes juicer is good extraction is good for the juicy fruits good design and takes less space in kitchen cons noise is there for the power it grinds but anyway not that high as mentioned in some reviews which read before my purchase steel jars get heated up quickly so used to refrigerate the soaked rice or dals to balance the heat just need to be careful while cleaning as there are some sharp edges which could hurt little wet grinding jar tips clean the jars immediately after use to make the cleaning easy with sponge so that jars won loose it shine bought this bosch mixer on and the motor is not working have to buy another mixer what is the use of putting such big amount in it it worked only for years it was only for household purpose purchased very much disappointed with brand showed to their mechanical he said motor is burnt from inside true to its name the bosch mixer grinder is great machine to have in your kitchen however the locks of the cap have given away and cleaning it is challenge na this is very good product overall the dosa idli and other such batters come out excellent the motor is powerful and can handle any mixing and grinding needs the only unsatisfactory thing about this is the juicer it works well with slightly watery fruits like citrus oranges watermelon etc but the moment it comes to fruits and vegetables with lower water content the juicer fails at extracting anything the juicer is basically another blender jar with mesh attachment to sieve out the pulp there is no option of being able to push the fruits closer to the blender blade which makes it difficult to crush them all in all an excellent product as long as you stick to the citrus juices was happy customer of sujata for the past years and bosch was good option good design powerfull motor worth for the price bought in offer it has powerful motor does grinding pretty fast compact size lid lock clip very useful priced high juicer function is not much useful,positive
bottle quality is not good best for hot water per the price bottle is not sturdy and very light weight kettle is also thin but heats fast like other market standard both bottle and kettle should be sturdy has to handle very delicately otherwise dent will be inevitable the product is good package the bottle accompanied is regular steel bottle and not thermos the kettle is very difficult to clean so better avoiding doing anything which stains it the switch seemed to get jammed but with little push it started to work again steel quality not good the kettle is good for winters you can boil the water within few minutes but the length of cord is short it would be better if it is long overall the experience was good you can go for it it is truly an amazing product for your parents that why rating it star good,neutral
bought for as my travel tool to easy ironing product with good quality nice good light weight good according to price ok vf,neutral
bought havells lts instant geyser kw white blue and really happy made this decision let me start with why went for instant geyser instead of storage geyser storage geyser have tank to store water and heat it for example litre storage geyser fills up the litre tank and then heats the water as it has to heat high volume lts of water it takes time of about to minutes instant geyser on the other hand heat water instantly within to minutes however the catch is they dont have huge capacity tank which means at given instant it has only small volume depending on tank capacity of hot water now who should opt for instant geyser and who should opt for storage geyser is the question if you like to have shower bath for which you require more than litres of hot water continously then you should go for storage geyser since storage geyser of capacity more than lts will store lts of hot water and provide it to you as soon as you turn on the shower without any pauses instead if we consider instant geyser of lts capacity for shower bath it cant provide you lts of hot water continously because for every lts it takes time to heat water again hence for shower bath better to go for storage geysers if you like to have bathtub bath then instant geyser are good to go because consider using bathtub bathtub generally is of capacity lts if you even use storage geyser of high capacity as much as lts still you will have pauses of to minutes each because at one shot this storage geyser can provide you only lts of hot water continously and then you will have to wait for mins for the next lts to heat so to fill the entire bath tub you need to have times lts of hot water lts so the total wait time would be times mins on an average mins in this scenario of bathtub bath its better to go for instant geysers since they provide hot water almost instantly and eventhough there will be pauses for every lts of hot water still the pauses being very small you ll have bathtub full of water with enough amount of heat hotness then you might ask what should we consider for bucket bath both storage geysers of lts or above and instant geysers of lts or above are good to go just choose based on price time taken to heat instant takes less time energy consumption instant comsumes less now coming to havells lts instan geyser of kw why bought this havells is great brand wanted to have it for bathtub bath kw heats lts of water in just to seconds what liked about this product have been testing it from week and it is really ossum as it is heating lts of water in just seconds have used timer to note that the installation was totally free however remember you will be charged if there is any plumbing work do be done no need to buy any extra accesories like pipes everything is provided in the box you just need to buy amp plug which would be less than rs as soon as the product was delivered by amazon got message from havells saying they have registered my installation request and the very next day the instalaltion was done thanks lot havells this might differ for you based on your location live in hyderabad really like havells customer service the geyser comes with years of warrenty for the whole and yrs of warrenty on the tank it has auto cutoff feature to stop further heating or wastage of electricity if you forgot to switch off however please switch it off once done because eventhough it has auto cutoff still once the water in the tank cools down it will again start heating and the cycle repeats it shows color indication blue when its heating and orange when it has done heating have look at the pictures have attached note go for the kw model if you want hot water instantly in to seconds the kw model might take to mins to heat lts of water make sure it is kw model because see reviews from other customers who say the mustard colored geyser is not kw but kw better go for white and blue color to be sure very nice product good product kw rated heater is able to heat water in minutes and maintain that temperature for continuous flow of hot water good product great product at great price value for money and instantly warm water comes in just min havella water heater water heats up in secs depending on the weather this review is after using this water heater continuously for days in december in kolkata with one of the days being extremely windy and lowest temperature at degree celsius during afternoon early evening hours on the coldest day so far it took around min seconds to heat up completely if you don have chronic pain or arthritis or this is not going to be used for very old people whereby really hot water is required for bathing think it can work perfectly for winters with lowest temperatures upto degrees because have chronic pain and use this to get really hot water and for shower not using bucket and it manageable obviously can be compared to steaming hot showers using storage geyser but this heats quite quickly so can be used in the shower even with the low capacity for that same reason it can be used for multiple people because by the time one person leaves the bathroom and the next enters you ll have fully hot water only of lesser quantity so if you don live someplace cold or don need very hot water but mildly hot water this can be used for multiple people as well installation support was also good no cons only that if havells introduces instant heater in the range then that would be game changer and might give storage geysers run for their money because this is perfect for anyone who doesn have their own home and might need to move around because it compact and provides instant hot water,positive
bought it around rs and have been using for around month feel this is good product and nice for office work from home the space is good for laptop inc and remaining space can be used for phone and other small utilities fan haven tried because have macbook great useful one for wfm persons especially my wife like it thank great produce easy to use comfortable cant use mouse on this table if ur laptop is initially it was fine but after days of usage when connect my mouse for gaming or editing its not comfortable like mouse on bed and laptop ft above it helped me lot for my months working from bed they can improve on sturdiness bit but overall good quality product and better price than all other products fits good for inch laptop without mouse used mouse on bed as it wont fit on the same table after keeping my inch laptop gr angle adjustment recommend it for friends and family like this product but if it has fans it would so nice because fan is not enough for heavy work or more hours of work and also fans place if its some what moved to the right side instead of mostly to the left side then the laptop gets the air correctly so laptop dont get much heat am writing this review after using this table for months it is very convenient the table doesn shake even if we use it on bed corners of the table are smooth and th material is really of good quality and the fan is really handy even use the use this table as cooling pad by folding and the legs and just put it on the table but only when we are watching videos and not typing ot else it will be shakey over all am happy that my money didn not got waste because search for table there are other brand for even less price like but choose this thinking that it is once time investment and need to buy and item which is durable and bought this and am happy with my decision like it only thing is little bit smaller than others and don find any use of fan,positive
bought it for don think that because this is cheap it will be poor quality product these clips serve the purpose perfectly fail to understand what can be improved by paying more for other similar clips second quality in this photo you can see my old ones on left after one year of use still shiny these are on right side in comparison colour is very dull probably due to recycled material still very useful product worth the price paid the clips are okay colour is bit dull compared to the picture given material is okay but its serving its purpose can buy it convenient cheap plastic but worth the price does what it says good quality doubting on its sturdiness average product,positive

bought it for my samsung series led tv the remote works use it mostly to control volume and source and it does its work am happy with it at first they had delivered one remote that didnt work and then got replacement which works as expected thank you great its replica of my old samsung remote have used it for month now and no issues good product works fine with my samsung smart tv no issues till now does everything the original remote does not genuine product seems brittle and little tough around the edges lighter than original remote probably due to the poorer quality of plastic but for my usage that ok as there are no kids to damage it barely use buttons in the entire remote source switch to hdmi for chromecast volume buttons play and pause it works even with older inch samsung tv with smart remote one,positive
bought it in january posting it in august so ve used it almost months and giving honest review in short if you are getting it during sale time then it steal deal also in regular price it good product sound quality is good enough loud at volume bass is also ok whenever needed it produces punchy bass overall balanced mic quality is good in indoor condition but in noisy environment you can rely on this recevier can clearly listen to you you can do gaming as company claiming low latency myself didn test it now about battery backup company claim it will give battery backup of hours with case hours in single charge additional hours times charge via case but in practical use it gives total hours playback it will give around hours backup on single charge of buds volume if you only listen to music or watching video but no call or gaming you can charge the earbuds full times via case so additional hours just one issue with it design suit case type box not easy to carry in pocket would say it personal preference if you are into good looks design then it not for you now it regular pricing varries between rs in this price range also it is one of the best tws under will tell why now days many brands are launching tws in the market under most of them sound almost similar difference is like they are just marketing their tws with huge hours of battery backup by youtubers reviewers hours of playtime is just myth ve personally used truke airbuds lite buds which is by far the most false promising brand claiming hours of battery in their every tws but only give hours even other tws of boat airdopes pro which claim hours playback only give around hours defy gravity claiming hours only give hours if you are impressed by their looks huge battery backup and thinking to buy those you will be disappointed after purchase instead go with this you will not be disappointed read the negative comments first and decided not to buy it because the comments said it gives high latency on gaming like pubg and also it falls from ear while running and that the difference between normal and beast mode slightly had difference but pubg youtuber recommended me this so decided to give it try after trying out myself let me provide the facts for you have boat rockerz headphone which obviously should be better than this airdope but this airdope surprised me by doing better in providing accurate sound in pubg its been days used it daily for hours on full charge it has no buttons and it works on touch sensor which was impressive for me and in pubg it doesnt give delay as written in the comments it has good latency better than what had expected from the negative comments sometimes though faced the issue where one side of the airdope stops working because its either on standby without detecting the user or bug which is included in the faq guide help card in the box im satisfied in terms of gaming for sports like running wouldnt recommend because it slips away however maybe can tie the airdope with thread attached to ur neck so that its safe from landing on the ground im gonna try that please dont use both the airdopes while running on the roads with vehicles running for your own safety keep one side of your ear free for hearing sounds from your environment pros the level of volume it gets to is just awesome it can get incredibly loud so if you re at the gym these are perfect awesome bass noise cancellation is just great if you simply put them on without even any music playing won be able to hear things around very well it great for places like gym lovely battery life ve had them week and only had to charge the case once that too for just few minutes and the earbuds themselves leave them in case for just five min and you ll be getting battery for long long while they are very comfortable can be used for long periods of time affordable the touch controls are very responsive tap to pause double tap right one for next song double tap left one for either rewind or previous song can also pick up calls just by tapping multiple ear coverings are provided with it type port cons the sound quality is not bad or anything but it is slightly muffled as compared to good quality headphones etc the bass is the highlight so it great for music but for movies or gaming you won get the most crisp audio some connectivity issues sometimes have to turn my bluetooth on and off many times for it to work this is occasional not daily or frequent occurrence edit after month use it now very frequent issue the mic quality is good if you are using your phone but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on pc sometimes on whats app the mic will not be detected if you are on call with these earbuds so you will end up having to take them off to accept call sometimes not an issue if you are the one dialing hope it just whatsapp issue rather than earbuds issue overall needed these for my gym since they play horrible music there lol so very very happy with them highly recommended for music and or as more affordable option as compared to jbl etc,neutral
bought it months ago for my hp inktank it working better than local ones colour quality is good like original colours not coming off from glossy photo paper don know about originality good to receive original hp ink from amazon it was also delivered in record time good for perfect printout the ink is missing otherwise it is genuine product very good printing and no problem at all however as said it is filled only or all buy original products to keep your product safe nice the ink quality is very good original product got perfectly packed bottles all sealed but the ink bottles are empty though the bottles are big and of large diameter so guess it contains ml ink the mouth of the bottle is big and ml syringe easily gets inside used this ink to refill my canon pg cartridges am surprise with the print quality and count of prints same deep black color like the original pg cartridge nearly th of the bottle is empty,positive
bought it when watched an instagram influencer showed this product and wanted to try hands on this quality wise it really good and since it made by logitech which has been in the market from too many years in pc accessories so less doubtful about it durability the best features once you pair your different devices to this keyboard using bluetooth switching connectivity is super fast like you won feel any lag in connectivity the instructions strap helps to well understand this product bought at but know it price had dropped to during diwali sale things hate about this product felt it would be light weight but it isn buttons are rounded but yes gives mechanical keyboard feel which is great for gaming buttons are too close to each other so your hands will take sometime to adjust and also the arrow keys are slim which don matter because as gamer you rarely use arrow keys it always wasd but yes will be problematic if you play fifa where there is extreme usage of arrow keys so for overall experience good portable keyboard can list out the pros and cons pros good connectivity with macbook pro latest os macbook keys are mapped properly as expected portable simultaneous connectivity with devices cons not an ergonomic keyboard its flat and doesn have any option to incline up dont have backlight keys you can not see the keys in dark room keys are slightly hard to press think due to rubber dome enter key feel is smaller which cant be sensed without seeing the keyboard overall my purpose got fulfilled as am able to use it with my macbook pro after struggling with logitech combo the keyboard is really good and it has good built quality and the only con is that there is no indication of whether the caps lock is on or off pros easy to use keys feels like mechanical keyboard can connect devices supports mac and windows place holder for mobile devices however use it to place pen cons expensive very heavy feels like macbook air there is lag in connection whenever you turn on your laptop price is litter high what an excellent product got my hands on smooth working and connect to different gadgets at the same time and can work on any of them buttons are of good size so typing is easy and fast the inbuilt holder for gadgets is really solid and helping and it connect to iphone also only uses for typing if horizontal view is suitable to see what we typing think twice before buying not working properly on macbook pro switches to junk characters frequently which is really frustrating how did fix the keyboard switches to symbol junk characters when the option key is pressed so had to disable the option key in the keyboard and live with it apart from that above problem it good looking keyboard the keys are smooth to handle due to its container for tablet phones the product is not as compact as you might be expecting,positive

bought this power bank to use during my vacation with family it is sturdy but bit on heavier side can charge three phones at time if you use the two usb and third type port as well for charging the speed of charging is alright and appropriate the one and only drawback experienced is the weight of the power bank itself without this limitation it could be really amazing product to buy bit heavy but does its job takes tooooooo much time to charge whatever mention in the description is not correct at all with regards to the powerbank charging needed an extra power bank with larger capacity so this time thought to give ambrane try as already have honor mi power banks ah ones though it was not perfect match for mi or honor ones iit did live up to my expectations for the range inside box

below on this part compact form factor sturdy design with abs body cons it does not auto start charging when the device is connected since it has touch button instead of push button it activates

if it was used product or was tampered in between so was skeptical about the authenticity of the product and ordered replacement right away this one had usb cable but no carry pouch when replacement came it came in poly wrapped bigger box cm mfg oct with an outer sleeve and main box inside with hologram seal maybe ambrane changed the packaging the hologram seal here was intact but was also not applied properly to secure the opening looked like it was applied with an open box so its presence was useless this one came with micro usb cable and carry pouch carry pouch as per my analysis carry pouch comes with the latest october lot which comes in bigger box and was unavailable in earlier lot with small box carry pouch size was appropriate for power bank and had no trouble inserting power bank in it some users reported it having smaller opening but had no trouble with it and found it to be proper fit neither loose nor tight its soft nylon meshed pouch and is nice addon verdict at the price point its not bad deal its midway path low quality and high quality ones you can very well go for ambrane as it makes good quality durable power banks rest nothing is perfect in this world for this thing only days replacement policy from amazon and year warranty from ambrame is available if one can extend the budget by few hundred mi power bank will be better option with metallic body better quality overall have mi honor ambrane power bank and their overall rating will be from low to high ambrane honor mi am putting up this review after day of usage this is the second power bank have bought from ambrane india overall third power bank for my family before to this have bought their pp mah model and also has mi mah power bank both were really good here am putting together all the pros and cons which am able to find after day of usage and also little bit of comparison my dad uses redmi note my mom has mi and am using redmi note pros dual input type and micro usb this is the foremost and primary reason of choosing this power bank over mi or other brands as you don need to carry two cables if your phone has type input which in my family out of has the same easy to carry and hold as it is very compact is size must say in comparison to mi or ambrane pp solid and sturdy built mah capacity with same lithium polymer batteries these are safer then lithium ion batteries this came to know while buying this product cheaper price than mi touch button at the top to know the power status this is something unique it took less than hour to charge my redmi note from to at cell battery indicator which is pretty good and almost equivalent to my wall charger best part same time and charging speed in delhi metro don know either it is pro or con both of my other power banks supports qualcomm quick charge technology while this power bank supports only fast charging at amp but feel this has charged my phone better and faster than mi power bank itself know phone must also supports quick charge technology for fast charging but when use quick charge on my dad redmi note which supports qc either from mi power bank or ambrane pp power bank it kind of heats up the phone also it fluctuates the power and automatically switches between quick charge and fast charging which affects your battery life so it is safer to charge the phone at optimum current at amp cons very stuffy packaging it looks like the power bank has been forced fully stuffed inside the box it has some adhesive tape at the top don know why which when you remove it puts scratches on the top be careful while removing the same no torch light their pp have it only micro cable inside the box definitely heavy but knew this will recommend this as it has slots so we can charge two phones nice product power backup is good but the usb cable provided is very bad it stopped working after few months of usage everything is good but the battery dont last that long when use for charging two device,positive

bought this product with the hope that it would be good and stable selfie stick but it didnt help at all it is not suitable for large phones like iphone pro max very clumsy and the tripod doesnt stand at all keeps sliding had very difficult time to set up the selfie stick pros useful stick stable only till half length after that it shakes like crap bluetooth remote is given which is very very useful infact necessary would say cons useful only till half opened after that it shakes like anything lacks mount to mount any led flashlight for low light videos biggest con cost of batteries is more than the selfie stick itself now as have no money for going for gimble so am using this as well as bought spare batteries costed me rupees for batteries although must say that you can find the cr battery the one used in this one much cheaper than what paid on either local ecom website or local shops one must have this tripod to get full family picturethe quality is upto the markand it is standing strongly with weight of phonebluetooth control is quick and clear if you are taking photos with your family at home then it is good but if you are single rider and ride solo then its length is normal you will get only half of your photo it should be of such length that the rider can take complete picture with his riding gears then it is good for the riders my suggestion is that it should be more length everything is perfect except if you pull the tripod to long hight superb good at all haven used it much product is good its neat and clean remote works well the part where phone keeps thats too hard to open and it needs to be more sturdy,neutral

bucks piece can save cable worth hundreds totally recommend just received it and applied on my iphone related cables and connectors specially apple accessories are not that sturdy and doesnt last long due to breakage at the end points due to wear and tear this seems to be very good and low cost investment to protect all of such cables to break due to usage and wear tear have applied in earphones also will be watching over the period if time if it indeed increases the cables life till now feeling good about this useful product price is high you can go for this it is useful after using it the durability of the cable is good very good product it definitely protect your cable it doesn really protect your cable if the cable is starting to wear out you need to use this before the cable starts wearing out it works only if the cable is thick enough but overall good quality good,positive

cord is small and sound while heating well built and the buttons have smooth positive feel to the action the kettle heats efficiently and does exactly what it was designed to do and does it very well well worth the extra cost highly recommend excellent this is better than expected easy to use really fast nd above all its safe the length of the cord is okay if you have dedicated spot the vessel or else half foot more will be better and comfortable can recommend this to all wire length is very small product quality is excellent using the same model for the past yrs without any issues we use it for boiling water we boil the water for drinking and for making tea we use the kettle atleast or times day an twice in day we boil water with its full capacity so we boil water or cups to full capacity everyday recently the lid got detached so purchased new one with the same capacity and model to my surprise the kettle comes with bigger plug for which we don have suitable socket hence returned the product and received refund promptly there is no mention of the plug size in the product description give star to the product and wish to buy again only if it is provided with plug hope philips takes note of this advice please use it only for boiling water and there will be no trouble works for years the kettle opening is not so wide compared to some other makes but that will not be an issue if it used only for boiling water as intended chord length is less product is worth,positive

cost effective this is good for heating your personal self and you will need to sit next to it over hours it will heat up big room the auto switch off does work very light would have loved if the cord has bit longer its light weight and convenient to use but the jali gets heated need to work on it to make it remains cool like havells fine be ready for increased rs electricity bill monthly in winter during this device use bit costly otherwise better than the competition useful for very small room only and consumes lot of energy doest blow heat too far very less heat doesent heat room properly it is not able to hear my small sized room think you should go for rod heating heater,positive

design of the keyboard and mouse lenght of the wire is short value for money worth it good nice product good for lightweight use ocassional gaming can be done uplifted keys keep your hands soft while typing although it is quite cheap and works nicely for me think this is not for those who look for soft touch keyboard keys feel lose and needed to be hit little harder also the enter key is upside down compared to most keyboards around as result the key is in the second row instead of the first could be irritating for those fast typing guys go for it value for money,neutral

device was sturdy and handy suction power is quite strong all the attachments are good except the extension pipe was so weak that it gets crumpled when it comes in contact with any object bought this to get rid of dog hair on my bed and it does the job quite nicely it gets rid of dust very easily very handy and durable product this is very strong so while that is good for certain things it can also be little difficult to vacuum as the it sucks in the surface making it difficult to glide along the surface also it does heat quickly so you have to keep pausing however overall for this price it quite an amazing buy good product that cleans dust from upholstery and floors variety of attachments help for different surface cleaning good suction capacity long cord makes it more useful since you can reach greater distances from the plug point only reason for stars overall is that when using it some dust comes out from the collection compartment the closing seal could be made more firm so that there is no air leakage out easy to suction the spider nest on the wall and other corner dust great product works great for the price it is coming for as usual it is not heavy duty vaccum so that means it is will get heated up give mins break and use affordable and easy to use fits the purpose good nice cozy machine easy to use and good looking,neutral

does the job well doesn work on sand though the suction is very good the sand stays back no matter which lead you use ok ok easy to use product used it for the first time without knowing the know how of its use cleans almost of your mess inside the car highly recommended pros look and feel easy to hold and handle cord length useful led light during night normal suction power but good enough for general use cons noise is bit loud suction power could be better good hmm strudy design quality accessories reputated brand have seen some car vaccum cleaners especially the low cost one where dust comes out of machine due to poor locking mechanism so ofcourse you don want the dust to be falling back when the sole purpose is to remove it you get what you pay for have home vaccum clear from same company with has good suction and does the job well wanted battery pluggable clearner where can use it anywhere believe me no vaccum cleaner is good enough for heavily soiled cars so if you are expecting commercial level cleaning the don buy any car vaccum cleaner is portable device which gives decent satisfaction but not perfect have seen some people who do not take out mats and just shove the cleaner in it and say it not good mats need to be take out which actually collects big dust and derbies this poor small machine can handle cleaning on that if the car is heavily soiled the you must get it cleaned at professional clearner then start using the small one found this to be doing the job when compared to my house vaccum clearner one thing observed was the wires was getting hot and has soft component which makes it even thinner when it hit but think can handle the job accessories quality is good and fir and finishe is good did not seen any dust seeping through the compartment and it was well contained in the dust chamber suction is decent and you can give almost clean and tidy look to your car with this machine again professional grade cleaners can doa good job which cost nothing less tha would say worth buy it used delligently by not expecting too much only hope if the company can provide bag to carry it for the price or find one in your own which can fit your needs perfect,unknown
does the work good superb all good philips trust worthy product very easy to use and light weight iron great product has many features but using them is tricky tried to use the steam and spray for few weeks and gave up wish the product owner had focused little more on easy of use there is no point in having great functionality if end user can easily use it overall it good but after month inside wire was disconnected it stopped working it took me another days to get it fixed by near by electrician using it for month so far it is working well heats up quickly like the quality of product and steam functions,positive
doesn always stay at the neck of the cable but does help in reducing bending and stress would however recommend just getting some connector cables to avoid this issue altogether good useful product weak packaging but all the pieces came they are not the most sturdy but they are value for money would repurchase good product this cable protecter is really saved my cable very easy to use got so many in one pack must buy product definitely not worth the huge mrp quoted paid for pieces the material seems to be recycled remains to be seen if it will last serves the purpose of strengthening the flex point for cables have installed these on all my usb charge cables simple and good product best solution to broken wire,positive

easy and quick heating price is best in class year month additional warranty on registered device is very good in class best product for those who uses occasionally times in year because it will last for years if use is limited overall very good product is better automatic but heating temparature is not good manual is good product works best and quick just its quite light weight overall the sandwich maker is good the length of the power cord is not sufficient easy to prepare sandwiches of any thick it is very good product decent cord length the grill marks on my sandwiches and panini come out excellent value for money is good considering bought this for inr it totally worth the spent you can make one sandwich panini at time but only cook for myself so don find any issue with that but again it depends on the size of the sandwich go for it very nice product ideal for small kitchen needs very light weight power capacity get heated very quickly say only one drawback powercord length is really very small it should be longer atleast metre to metre would be ideal otherwise its great product the best thing like about this is the facility of big sandwich maker in small size there is no other company offering this design in this size very good thanx,neutral

easy to install working great recommended for light use if you want to use hard disks without lagging then will suggest to buy self powered usb hub the product does what it is intended to do however it does not compliment the sleek laptop use it with probably direct plug in extension no cord would be much better option needed portable usb extension headphones keyboard and mouse serves the purpose for an indoor setting have explained why it is not an outdoor device under the cons pros nice design sleek unobtrusive suits some work environments for those who have limited table estate go for models that have vertical usb slots saves space this is for those who can have it flat next to the laptop computer check image works well for audio hids and great for data transfer observation an interesting observation when using usb keyboard the usb drive is as if not more sensitive than direct typing with mechanical usb keyboards there is latency but chiclet and usb dongle based wireless keyboards seem to work well usb or wireless usb rf mouse works perfectly very little noticeable latency not for gaming purposes keyboards mice joysticks etc this is no brainer in rapid response gaming environments were latency is life or death an extension is not an option cons check image the usb female slots in the extension are shallow the male plugs do not go in fully there is cm of the metal plug exposed this may be risk in exposed outdoor environments humidity increases the chances of electric shock and dust being an insulator may cause static electricity build up the worst case is if conductor falls across the exposed points the whole system can short out suggest the designers take this into consideration for their next batch of products the depth of the usb slots needs to accommodate the full length of the usb plugs functionally it works design leaves lot wanting go for it if are sure you can be safe go for different model if you need this for outdoor use update th nov on connecting the keyboard to the usb drive there seems to be an increased latency and sometimes the keyboard does not respond as anticipated the text does not appear on the screen immediately and sometimes particular letter just cascades repeatedly and one has to press backspace often to delete the excess letters for data transfer it works fine but has lower speeds when all four slots are being used expected probably works well and does the job like it very much value for money product is excellent just that wire is very short rest all good using in laptop useful usb multiplier and works well for headsets too was apprehensive earlier if it deteriorates the audio quality only drawback is the length of cable as it keeps protruding out of laptop bag,positive

edit this doesn change my review actually it probably makes it lean even heavier towards the star than star rating but actually sat on the keyboard while it was on my chair an absolute unit of dude weighing kg and the keyboard wasn affected at all genuinely surprised first of all give this instead of the but rounded it up instead of down because there more to like than dislike product was delivered promptly but the packaging was in rough shape when unpacked it the keyboard had three missing keys iirc it was left alt and the windows keys turned over the box and dumped everything and voila the missing keys fell out not off to great start but slapped those keys on which was very straightforward meaning that replacing keycaps in the future will be relatively easy and plugged in the receiver to my laptop no setup or rd party software necessary it just started working instantly pretty seamless only use the keyboard when connect my laptop to my tv and sitting at distance use my laptop keyboard otherwise absolutely love the keyboard was expecting it to feel wonky and cheap but it actually feels decent it not super premium but it much better than what was expecting for the price it has flip stands on the back to raise it and an on off switch if you want to conserve battery the keys themselves are full sized and as someone with larger hands really appreciate it the curve around the space bar looks cool but don think it adds anything ergonomically the typing experience is nice the keys have enough feedback to them not mechanical levels obviously but still satisfying enough the caps lock key has little raised bit to it so you can feel it without looking at it and don accidentally hit it while typing neat little addition the shortcut media keys on top all work fine with windows there not much else to say about the keyboard it should be more than sufficient for everyday office browsing school tasks and will be good and comfy for people who type lot do not buy this expecting gaming level keyboard with antighosting etc or buy it expecting to have the durability of true mechanical keyboard was initially going to mark it down for not having any backlight at all but given the budget that understandable and acceptable overall very much like the keyboard and find it to be above par for what you pay the mouse on the other hand no pun intended is mediocre at best the build quality is not good it does not feel good when you use either of the click buttons you can feel the inner mechanisms groaning like it gonna fall apart at any time the mouse also starts lagging randomly the lag only lasts couple of seconds but it occurs enough to be an annoyance also it just doesn feel good in your palm have an amazon basics mouse that purchased while was in the us for rs and that thing feels so much sturdier and better built than this it also has no lagging issues and the clicks feel smooth even after few years of use as an overall package would say it decent for the price there are lots of other sets in this price range and picked this literally because of the logitech branding since own few other logitech products and enjoy them lot the keyboard is doing all the heavy lifting here and carrying it mouse friend hope they improve the mouse going forward because then this would be the best combo in this range as it stands right now it fairly indistinguishable from its competitors recommended for people looking for an affordable wireless set for everyday computer work and people who type lot not recommended for gaming or any form of power users it might work for single player games like city builders grand strategy rtses etc but would not recommend it for any form of shooters especially online the mouse simply isn up to task the keyboard is good and working nice for me the mouse is too small and not able to use properly and getting pain after using for very less time only it will be good if the mouse is in regular size also the mouse is lagging bit even after changing the settings using this product since one year not any problem found even battery cell not change don really know if it worth the cost or not but mainly prefer silent typing and mouse clicks ergonomic is also must as use these for long hours currently use logitech mouse which is really awesome and makes almost no noise at all great product have been using this product for years it battery is great still running the keys could get hard with time therefore had to use wd to lubricate them after years some random keys have stopped working such del semicolon numpad the mouse right click isn functioning anymore the left click has irritating double click issue so not suited for fps games speed and connection is adequate no lag noticed the keyboard collects lot of dust so better to cover it ergonomics are great no issue with that if you re looking for longer size keyboard for approx years of proper functioning for daily or official use then it is good purchase mouse is small and comfortable even for left handed people keep in mind the keys will become stiff over time purchased it for my personal use which includes mostly working it has good connectivity both for keyboard and mouse have not faced any issue with it have not tested its performanace,positive
entire product including the beating machine nd other pair of dough hooker is absolutely perfect but the important pair of steel beater is really poor in quality rusty pair of beater ve been delivered nd that too very disappointing rather doubt whether they are made of actual steel or not would have really appreciate if the quality of beaters can be improved coz the entire product other than this justifies it value product for making cake cream have used this product more than months no issue no complaint good working it good if used properly like this product its such good product by kent best part is that after buying got call from kent and they took full review about the product very good product go for it easy and nice good usage,positive

everything is great love this very good and working very nice first of all thanks to amazon for listing it as returnable item and at an effective cost of less than coming to the device itself the reason for purchasing it is to experience google tv on that account the interface is more useful than the standard android tv one in terms of discovery but the listed content is not that relevant however it is realme that lets the user down the device was bug ridden from the beginning and they basically abandoned the device in months with the last software update in feb still riddled with bugs and never to see google tv the stick heats up enough to scald you if you touch it and it stutters like crazy after usage of over day in part due to the lackluster arm cores which is lacking in performance compared to cores present in sticks from over years ago and also due to poor ram management only reason to get it would be for the price if it is less than but be prepared to suffer through laggy interface and the known issues of the remote failing within few months still males more sense to get fire tv stick which is more refined and receives more updates although the interface is love or hate it one for the google tv experience it is better to go with google tv with chrome cast but that costs bomb in india for what it offers got used product it was trapped and also proformance is twice degrade to fire stick also not sucking wifi well as computer to fire stick,positive
everything is nice including design function works as intended and mostly as description but here are things that couldimproved the upper lid should be able to open up bit more to the back if we want to wash it more thoroughly since having lid not open in way that it goes bit back enough for the lid to not feel bit in the way its not as comfortable as it could be this shouldnt become point which should make ppl avoid buying it though since many other models seem to open up till the same angle as this one does unless you found one that opens up more than this one if you already bought it or still want to buy it you can use big bottle brush to scrub it even tho your hand can go in but you ll feel like you have to be more careful while washing to not accidentally hit the lid you can see from my image product image rest of the body seems sturdy but the handle feels bit lighter than the body so it makes me wonder if handle would fall off due to daily strain when pick up the kettle by handle alone may be it wont break come off but hold the kettle with both hands on both ends just in case to be safe these are two things like to be improved if agaro makes any changes in the model features in future didnt return it though because chances are other models are the same or similar and apart from all that it works well so yeah very good kettle and big in size cord length is good it is very robust in temperature control that is to say on and off manual and automatic off regarding cord it is watts kettle which is on the top of ordinary indian domestic non power plug they have given one meter quality wire with plug this means if your home wiring can stand watts on ordinary non power plug you can use it in any socket anywhere the switch in the kettle is bit wobbly not sure whether it is purposely designed so initially was not pleased now love it because of majestic performance product looks good value for money seems good until now hope will last long good purchase kettle is nice and cord length is also good but package is not good at the time of delivery it was opened,positive
everything was good just issue found with the rubber which is used to tighten this but replaced that with my old one rest all good it slightly leaking from the side after installation it bottom should firmly stick to the surface and seal properly what is the logic of tape sealing the top flap when the cartridge can be taken out and replaced back through the unsealed bottom flap of the product carton in contrast the carton of the pure it cartridge is sealed both at the top and the bottom tata swach should correct this anomaly star like need to change frequently good quality good quality product,positive

first of all delivery of amazon it was as specified no delays hence appreciate it packaging not good the box was tempered torn and damaged product ordered black received brown didnt replace as the color didnt much mattered issue is with the seller though performance the pen of good robust feels cheap however looking at the price not to complain writes smooth for anyone who wants to enter into fountain pens can start with this as it does the job edited have been using this pen for over days now am facing issue of nib dryness if dont use the pen for sometime the pen doesnt write at all have to wet the nib or do something or the other in order to make it start writing it writes great when it starts writing but the initial pick up is really bad have platinum preppy too its better option to go with if the budget is tight however there we have good writing but bad looks few points have been reading about this pen which would like to answer compared with two other pens parker vector and luxor grip read in couple of reviews regarding the thick grip and the curve at the grip which makes it awkward to hold honestly have not felt so at all the grip is pretty medium larger than parker vector and comparable to the luxor it wont create any problems holding it am an average and people of same build hand and finger size wont be any problem also on parker vector the metal body starts to feel slippery due to metal small grip and feels tiresome after writing couple of pages been nice to hold the elegante and feel firm in hand it makes one feel like holding pen with substance nib and feeder it says fine on the nib and it is comparable to the luxor and parker fine nib few claim it is medium kinds its all about the pressure on puts when writing it just touch the nib on paper and rest the pen does so would say it is fine it is way too smoooooother and fluent than parker which felt bit rough parker fine nibs give feedback making it bit of dragging experience however on elegante the nib just flows and slides over the paper it is not only the nib but also the feeder which ensures the nib slides the feeder ensures that there is even flow of ink through out the writing experience the writing it leaves is slightly wet and not dry personally prefer that over the dry and dragging this ensures that one gets to write about pages sides without refill plastic construction and feel in hand the cap is made of brass as they say the cap has matte finish not glossy one the clip and top is glossy gives fair enough good contrast to add some looks to it when taking it out of the pocket the pen itself very much plastic if try to weigh both the cap and pen separately roughly they feel of same weight it is that light weight just feel factor how felt however this does not mean it is cheap construction it has fallen from floors down and did not crack anywhere so would say its good strong plastic it makes one feel pretty solid holding it the size if compared to other two is larger it rests pretty well in between my thumb and index finger which parker does not luxor does hence never needed to put the clip on the rear without the clip it is very much balanced parker and luxor both feel well balanced without the cap placed on top with clip elegante and parker feel bit top heavy ink filling personally always been fan of eyedroppers good old school days however this comes with the standard piston filling as seen in the photo by hari when immersed the nib in the pen and pulled the piston it just filled half had to dip the whole nib till the grip when it got filled in parker just dipping the top nib was sufficient for luxor pulling the whole top part out and then refuel it seemed very tedious some other reviews read people have tried removing the piston converter and used it as eyedropper few said it worked few said it leaked need to substantiate it not sure and hence wont try this out to spoil such nice piece if anyone has tried would love to hear your experience writing after weeks for luxor it works immediately even after months it worked like magic for parker bit of dipping or couple of splashing out and it starts for elegante it did not start immediately from school days used to have an airmail unfortunately misplaced it when shifted it used to work like beauty even after weeks elegante on this aspect did not fair so well however how many of us are not going to use their pen for weeks always something to write sign or pen down it worked fairly after break of one week colour personally the looks of pen hardly matter to me its the balance in hand and the nib which are the real heart and soul we pay crazy on high class pens just for the looks for few people this matters more individual choice and nothing against it parker gives good classy look luxor makes one feel more of student than person with authority or executive elegante would be mix of both and middle of both neither college going look nor an executive look on looks it does fair enough justice the cap and two metal rings is all that makes it stand apart would have loved if they would have made more colours than maroon black and blue nonetheless these colours are the royal colours and pretty good than what reynolds have bright designs which are more for school going kids to attract them this does enough for me spare nibs and feeder not sure if there are spare nibs available online am at location which is of km away from any civilization in jungle or desert and only way is to order online thankfully speed post delivers faster than couriers lticaptd after using this nib would personally not place any other nib am pretty happy about it always good habit to have spare nibs dont know when one drops it and needs to change recommended for its must for student at this price range where one is still studying and not earning this sounds good buy though not the best as luxor beats this is vfm parker would never recommend it for students if someone wants to carry it for exams carry atleast all due to the limited piston converter capacity luxor would be best if you are an executive sitting in board of meetings where you want to make statement by what you carry then there are many other alternatives this is fair on looks and pleasure for writing value for money for standard person like me or student luxor beats elegante and parker however for fountain pen this is an excellent vfm well this sums up my experience after using it anyone has anything more to add to this or share their side we all would love to hear it first of all it came in really bad condition the package was almost flattened all thanks to the people connected with the transition and delivery thank god it doesn have any dent secondly it is probably used product because it came with the smell of ink in it out of the box thirdly the brand claims that it is having fine nib but probably according to the european standards am pilot lover so know what fine nib is this is medium sized nib at its best according to the standards of pilot using pen with fine nib is like having perfect orgasm you remember the experience for long time the handwriting also becomes better that lacking in this pen thankfully it doesn squirt ink every now and then like most of the other cheap fountain pens had two wingsungs those were unbearably squirty fourthly the grip is average fifthly if you are beginner you may go for it as it will obviously let you get used to the fountain pens you may use it as day to day pen but don stick with this one only explore the world of pilot if you have the budget trust me you won look back to pen like this was gifted pilot crocodile fine nib by my mom want to keep my memories with this pen safe so don usually use that that why ve bought this one lastly and most importantly suggestion to the buyers to make your pen experience ergonomic please don put the cap on the backside open the cap keep it aside and unleash your writing very nice pen it really amazing very smooth writing thank you seller amazon its not for speedy writing if you are use for signature its cutting off character some time spread over ink and some time character cutting cheap plastic product but at good for beginners ve been using this pen for about monthspros build quality for this price is amazinggold nib looks amazingcons nib comes out easily just that the neck area of the pen was little broad for me to get used to guys have started using fountain pens again few months back had used all types of fountain pens during my school days like college brand eye droppers camlin parker made in usa hero china made recently am using platinum preppy which is very smooth and excellent pen and yes expected since it is japan made this the camlin elegante is our very own made in india pen it makes us proud just superb pen very smooth it is actually no nonsense pen only thing since had read few negative reviews about this am using it with pilot blue ink don know whether ink quality is further improving its performance or what whatever it may be this pen with pilot ink combination rocks just superb experience of writing with the fountsin pen thank you camlin and thank you amazon,positive
first of all found it bulky not sure whether it has good sound or loud sound but believe me guys if you are sound lover just go for it it has really good sound as every sound is separated crystal clear nice ya satisfactory work speed okay performance is very good gb in such small size wow value for money good,positive
first of all the item looks good attractive the front and back side covers are good feels smooth and premium give it star considering the below points also thanks to amazon for superfast delivery paper quality nice used ball pens sketch pens and also inkpens all cases no soaking of ink binding spiral binding and qality is good and attractive sturdiness here it could have been little better considering the price tag light weight binding and paper quality is nice still lite weght that plus writing experience better than average available notbooks in similar pricetag first off the notebook design is great pages are nice and smooth but bit on the thinner side the subject dividers are thicker than other pages the qc has some issues as of the one unit ordered for testing this product rs some pages were folded up from the corners and become larger when unfolded as depicted in the picture above many pages were glued onto each other hence tearing some part when flipping them again illustrated in the picture added above its an absolute steal deal for rs per piece as no other notebook competes in the spiral bind page market and notebooks of about pages non spiral bound of simillar size are sold for rs as of writing this review the only downside found besides the qc is that it doesn include an index page otherwise it has some games riddles and notes pages like other notebooks and the first page is dedicated to the owners details and contact great to see it present overall recommend this product because of the value for money and the quality understand my unit was one off as other reviews don seem to mention this will update after using this for few more weeks the product is worth the money the paper quality was good and it has six separations for six different subjects valu for money premium quality ordered only one copy was bit damaged from the binding got all the same design notebook which is little disappointing me except that everything is fine good product,positive
first of all wanted to buy one juicer to have juice instantly so reviewed many juice blender and finally bought this philips hr made carrot apple orange promoganate etc all did and had fantastic juice fruit pulp and waste all collected in one tray and it is easy to wash thanks for this instant juice blender good deal find this juicer amazing end to end it takes me around mins to extract the juice clean pack it back that easy it is to use the product is very good and user friendly exactly as demonstrated in video used to have juicer many moons ago but it was cheap model and never really produced the juice wanted and couldn afford the mega posh ones which juiced fruit and veg to within and inch of its life so was excited to be able to start using this new one first off this is nice compact design it really doesn take up much room and it has small suckers on the base to keep it in place on the kitchen surface the juicer is simple to take apart and put together instructions are not really needed though there are some basic pictures provided on the box the juicer spout where you put your fruit and veg in is quite small need to cut up my apples into quarters to fit them in and although this is not huge flaw it is shame as you wouldn need it to be much bigger to get them in so far my juicing attempts have all been successful apples raspberries grapes cucumbers carrots have all yielded fair amount of great tasting juice also unwittingly popped chopped up mango in there without realizing it is one of the starchy fruits that is apparently doesn work with it seemed to work fine for me can see how banana or avocado might not work but the mango did produce juice so you may want to experiment the pulp left at the end is still fairly damp and found could easily squeeze liquid out but it in no way dripping and would say decent job had been done know that there is lot of goodness left in the pulp so if you want to use this then just make sure you clean your fruit before juicing and remove anything you wouldn want in the pulp that way once you have finished juicing you can just scoop out the pulpy goodness and do whatever you want with it juicers produce different quality juices there are really key areas to judge juicer on it juice quality some juicers produce higher amount of juice per food item you can tell by the drier pulp that is extracted some juicers produce frothier juice and warmer temperature juice signs of lower quality because the air and heat are evidence of the oxidization of nutrients faster spinning juicer centrifugal will often produce more heat and froth which is why the masticating style juicer slower chewing action creates better quality juice in terms of these key areas this philips does an alright job producing dry pulp and an excellent job with low froth and low temperature juice the slow masticating action is excellent and on par with other juicers to get more descriptive like to run the pulp of the philips through the juicer time to get extra juice out of it running it nd time and get hardly any juice one extra run of the pulp is sufficient the specs for this juicer claim you can clean it in under minute think this is little optimistic but that said its not too far off all the plastic parts rinse clean easily and quickly with warm water and the only part which takes little more effort is the metal sieve and grater this has teeny tiny holes in it to help separate juice and pulp and so it does get clogged up with stuff that said have found that using soapy scourer sponge and gently rubbing with the green side does the trick pretty swiftly it certainly does not take much elbow grease and found it very easy to clean off unlike my previous juicer where you needed to scrub for half an hour and you were still finding bits the next time you used it think this is pretty decent juicer for the everyday user yes it could produce little more liquid from the things it juices but it is certainly not bad and the stuff it produces is on the whole clear from bits the anti drip spout is not quite anti drip and you do need to watch out for juice on the fruit plunger when you put pieces in as have whipped it out too quickly and splashed drops of fresh juice all over the place for the current price would say it is well worth it high quality premium juicer with low noise and excellent ability to squeeze max to juice out of fruits and veggies the look and feel is outstanding and way above what other options are available have been using this for month now it is easy to use and clean and assemble but at times have seen that the pulp is also coming in the juice and sometimes it makes different sound while it is grinding feel the carrot and beetroot pieces should be cut bit smaller and not like slice cause if cut like slice flat one carrot slice got stuck within the blades and the machine made different sound and it was not giving more juice but could see the pulp try to cut the carrot pieces of atleast inch size like round one and not like slicebut overall good experience as make carrot and beatroot juice and it takes minutes to cut grind and clean very easy to use and very easy to assemble thanks perfect home juicer easy to clean assemble and comparable loves it,positive
first used non parker ink for my fountain pen and hesitantly switched to parker quink ink given the cost was many times higher than regular ink but it is worth every paise the quink ink is clearly worth it with its thick blue color and giving superb contrast on white paper best product good no dislike have ink pot of pilot and was thinking to buy the parker one rate is too high but quantity is too low the quantity is little best quality,positive
first would like to comment on the tab market of india the most peculiar thing have seen in india is when particular product is aimed towards students or education suddenly corporations go out of their way to milk money and under deliver as much as possible it is exactly opposite to how students are given access to technology in the usa you watch the prices of chromebooks tablets back to school offers in the us and compare them to india and it feels extremely unbalanced after the pandemic there was huge surge in the tab market and tier brands started delivering garbage for rupees snapdragon old mediatek gb ram abysmal non ips screen for just to mint money and take advantage of pandemic scenario and the circumstances of students this tablet brings the revolution am no student but bought this for day to day use and am an user of the normal big bezel th gen pad so my review will be comparative in nature also bought this at rupees so my judgements will be in accordance to the price paid if you are planning to buy an pad just buy it considering gb is enough for you and you use it for normie scenarios you do day to day stuff you will be satisfied with your ipad with its everlasting updates this tablet if compared spec vs spec give good challenge to the ipad for rupees even for it is fine build is fine although put tempered glass on the st day itself back is plastic but sides are metal and the back gets quite smudgy the ips screen is really good there is no backlight bleeding no dead pixels as you can see in the picture with the dark background am used to oled screens on phones so at first blacks may disappoint but oled is impossible at this price the screen is better than my th gen pad display it is brighter has more punchy colours blacks are darker on top of that hz panel hdr certification dolby vision support makes it great for content consumption it would be great device for xbox cloud gaming with the xbox controller attached to it display is the part of the device with which you interact the most and display is the highest point of this tablet snapdragon is fine in market where older mediateks and lower midrange snapdragons are dumped into the market hence say if you don want this just buy an pad but don buy any other android tablet at price point all are trash was fine with all those games which rule the market today it has less pixels to push than in phone and the bigger surface area helps in better heat dissipation so gaming is effortless can comment on how the battery will serve me in the long run but for now don see any drain or backup issues with content consumption or gaming it has watt charger in the box although it does support watt charging the bigger battery takes some time to charge with the inbox charger but my pad takes even longer with its trash charger and it has bigger battery and apple devices are extremely picky with chargers the camera is okayish just like most tablet cameras the pad has even worse cameras for document scanning it should be fine but other than that it is not much useful it is still better than what samsung and lenovo gives in range tablets the second highest point of this tablet is its quad speakers they are loud have depth are not sibilant and have brilliant stereo separation and soundstage they are louder and punchier than those normal non ultrabook thiccc laptops which cost they will hit you as massive surprise did not at all expect such good speakers they seriously outmatch those cheapo rs boat goat mivi generic speakers in terms of distortion at max volumes separation and low end of course those cheap speakers would be louder and more shrill but it is about quality vs quantity coming to the cons was it courage or something else that xiaomi couldn find place for mm jack not even dongle in the box they should seriously stop copying apple wrong habits and instead copy their good habits like long device support via updates although mitigated the issue by using portable dongle dacs like shanling ua ibasso dc etc which generally use with even my phones and my pc coz they are way better than on board audio of most devices except some devices like some lg phones with quad dac am an audio enthusiast so spend money on such products and you need not although it works with my old mi dongle just fine for rupees don expect the pen and people who are expecting pen with tablet should really open their eyes and look the disaster also know as indian tablet market and its offerings but for they could just offer bundle where you pay rupees more and get the pen as an add on the accessory market might not be that vibrant already there are no unofficial cases available from good brands there is one from nillkin here on amazon and the seller has the audacity to price it at rupees lol the official xiaomi folio case is magnetic slap on at the back and don trust those type of cases one more issue that would like to point out is that xiaomi lately has tendency to creep up prices by rupees within month or two by doing the good old gst bro so if it ever reaches for the gb version just close your eyes and buy an pad with card discounts so in nut shell for it is was no brainer but even for it is really good deal considering what its competitors are hope this was helpful have been using the mi pad for over month now and am only glad that didn spend more on an pad once the retail therapy phase of the device wears off what remains is the user experience while it is true for both devices find that more at ease with the mi pad for the sheer look and feel of the content watch in it also spend lot of time reading books and illustrated designs pdfs and often found myself amazed almost chuffed over how good the content looked that display gets the accolades for reason the mi pad largely meets my expectations and when people see this tablet the immediate comparison they make is how much it resembles the pad gross generalisation so here my take on apple pad th gen vs xiaomi pad if you have an apple device already and are especially looking to expand on the productivity element from the tablet you need to stick to the pad not just because it is going to regulate the standard but you will definitely miss out on the features that eco system offers so buy the pad if you are not concerned about the price tagare looking at designing with the apple pencil and are familiar with or going to use pro createare making an investment with this purchase and will not be back in the market for new tablet anytime soon intend to use the tablet for presentations and want to take no chances with the devicehave clear purpose for the sidecar feature if you don use it despite buying the pad you are missing out engage in lot of official video conferences and are prone to moving about and may accidentally go out of frame the pad has feature that addresses this to an extent are not expecting substantially higher results than the mi pad from the in built camera in general have proclivity towards the apple design their decisions and are generally happy with the software choices apple makes for you don really care about features beyond rigid list of activities you are certain the pad is able to do and that this list is unlikely to change in the near future looking for reliable product that will receive software support for long period of time are expecting the device to be used by responsible adults who are careful with the tabletare unaffected by hefty repair costs should the glass crack or the rear panel be dentedhave need to use touch idon the other hand buy the mi pad if you are looking at gaming on plethora of titles that are on the google play store and perhaps not found elsewheredon care much about the stock os cookie cutter experience and think customization is the only way you ll truly be happy with the tablet you use want the best quality of video and photo capture from tablet meaning better video calls and video capture this doesn mean the camera will replace the phone you already have but the pad is tool that goes the extra mile of taking good quality images scanning documents and allows edits on its large screen value video quality from the mi pad camera than the ai that drives the face tracking function pad offers want the most of the audio experience higher audio quality clarity and richness are expecting rich colour depth hdr quality video experience and will be spending more than of your time on the tablet watching videos don like limitations imposed on you as with the software you use sideload apks rooting custom firmware overclocking etc if you do any or all of these forget about the pad are mostly going to use it as fun device to watch movies on or consume audio visual mediaare not expecting to pay an arm and leg comparatively to fix broken screen or damaged back panel are okay without fingerprint scanner and is okay with face id pin or pattern for security at the end of the day you as user of the tablet spend most of your time looking at the glorious screen of the tablet and interacting with what inside the device not the logo at the back the tablet is totally fine but sometimes is bucked out there is so many bugs bugs glitches have contact to xiaomi they will try to fix it one req don upgraded after you buy don have to do after the update not single google application is running on floating window and while split screen there is so many black patches around the bar white bar sometimes nice tablet you can go with it and if you are thinking about productivity multimedia go for it because most mostly as student do presentation word excel taken notes and all the things and handle easily were by this tablet and am using it for games and other purposes it handle it quite nicely but you have to wait for android because android is good for tablet new update is here so the new android update is here unfortunately is not android but is working fine all the bugs has been fixed few miner bugs are there but it totally refined from the past and system is working great hertzs now looks amazing because animation bugs has been fixed and battery life is been fixed is now working more than hours fortunately video playback and for day to day task you can go easily to days because am doing ppt excel sheet and other documentation it work totally fine and yeah that the new update and go for xiaomi back about pencil so bought xiaomi pencil for and if say latency has been improved but if if you don have the budget of go for another shopping site which name after cart yeah and you can buy it smart buy pencil for rupees it works fine too and you don have to spend you can go with the just you will not have those key features like taking screenshots and write something on it or double tap to note down over all am satisfied with this tablet,positive
firstly got the cracked jar but the product replaced the very next day like the new and compact design of the product easy to clean and assemble and the powerful motor with no speed option chopper choped and blender blend wonderfully things dislikes the most is the noise its fully plastic material the only thing which is not plastic to open eye is the blades only and the juice extractor which isn juice extractor actually always wanted juicer and then found this it works like magic so easy and so quick the blender is also good using it almost every day for my juice and milkshakes the major problem with this is that it doesn have regulator and also no on and off switch that the major drawback over all liked it no other issues good product the product is so good but got cracke in chopper jar after using just two or three time so let me know can exchange it only chopper jar the product build quality good using the product is very easy and after use cleaning is very easy too build quality is good and jars are nice the first impression of the product is it very sleek and easy to use and handle it very much good for spices and chutney masala specially dry masala grinding was very good it juice making skill was so so nice it very easy to clean bought this mixer grinder and juice blender combo it is very handy and effecient in usage grinds all dry and wet material nicely the juicer gives fresh juice and removes all seeds without giving bitter taste crushes ice also well blender makes all kind of shakes and smoothies great for everyday use we can use easily good product for all use it inmy daily routine,neutral
for it might be too small also it wobbly was good enough for not making me return it if you own gaming laptop and want some elevation for those fans it not bad purchase but the temperature is not much but good for eye level as it has simple design it may not block air flow but it will not comfortable if you use laptop keyboard as it will start shaking as it doesn provide such stability and so it is nor usable for typing purpose you must have to use external keyboard and mouse as expected small form factor under slightly rough usage bottom pads came off but still works as expected quality product best to buy good,positive
for the product like room heater package should be enough so that it does not get damage and they have not used proper amazon packaging price is quite high according to size and capacity of the product after using days have found some defects and some scratch marks attached in the pics the heater is very compact light weight and effective it looks so cute in room and doesnt disturb your aesthetics at all loved it ordered another one for my grandmother product is useful good product have purchased of them recommend to my friends who have bought it but now looking for the same which is not available here control knobs should have marked scales on the body otherwise performance of the heater is good without noise value for money and sufficient for sqft room received the faulty product very good room heater main features of the heater is it fan hot air circulation in average size room is very good,neutral
for this price range product design look spec and features provided is good it would be great if havells pay attention in packing as the product box received first had manufacturing defects and mising parts flexible pipes after placing replace request with amazon received other box which also had some minor scratches in the heater body and also found fastners were missing in the box good product at this price heating is also very good the major cons of this brand is installation problem the installation workers never come for installation at your home so you can arrange installation workers otherwise every things is good havells should send trained technician for installation the technician was asking for additional rs charge for installing tap of rs and labour charge which personally did it very disgusting guy havells to look inti the matter technician do not have proper tools with him and he asks from all tools from customer including nails pliers hammer etc this geyser is worth to the money product as it only takes max of minutes to make iced water very hot as well as the indicator of the product is very good as it can be be clearly seen by low vision persion due to its size and colour deptness and also makes the look of geyser very good overall good water heater deducted star as the circular piece covering the light keeps coming off did not replace as it did not impact the function of the water heater value for money good installation service attractive and suits for my bathroom it good product and value for money good product at this price,positive
for those looking for genuine review brief comparison summary between the best three earphones headphones in the budget segment let help you to make up your mind the review is for sennheiser earphone but items for comparison are sennheiser hd ii over the ear headphone sennheiser cx in earphone sony mdr xb ap in ear extra bass earphones just for an introduction would like to mention am dire fan for flagship electronic goods manages to fulfill my passion for the taste of quality from time to time now lets begin when you start looking for earphones or headphones sennheiser is definitely brand worth to look for and rightly so the brand has acquired great reputation of producing some top notch quality gears in its segment too started my quest to purchase some of the best sounding earphones within reasonable limits of purchasing power excluding those insanely pricey ones read some very good reviews of the sennheiser hd ii professional over ear headphone from my fellow amazonians and bought it found it to be reasonably good but having certain drawbacks may refer my review of hd at amazon which were not upto my taste next unsettled went to purchase these sennheiiser cx in earphones and here are my observations design construction looks feels delicate to hold with its extremely thin wires and if you are casual in handling frequently then in the long run its sure to fail wires which are around in expanse are not tangle free and keep getting into random knots each time you get to use it comes with different sized earpieces to snug fit different ear anatomies and provides decent sound isolation but not the best inconvincing design of the earpiece globes as the bottom tail piece below the earpiece was not large enough to grip with fingers to comfortably fit or adjust the earpieces in the ears and each time you had to twist the spherical globes to snug fit comes with gold plated shaped additional adapter for better fitment to laptops etcf comes with small pouch which for the most part was useless accessory for me case or box would have been more more elegant option squeezing the whole earphone into the li ll pouch everytime naah feels primitive but then its my own two pieces sound quality performance the sound quality is crisp clear with clear mids and crisp pitches bass was okayish but leaves you craving for more every time you plug it in to watch some movie or natgeo documentaries the lack of an adequate bass may even get unsettling sometimes the frequency response as per specs was to hz against to hz of sony mdr xb ap just to quote sonys bass could get really deep low with its mm drivers and neodymium magnets for purists senneheiser does its job quite honestly but in general as for sony little make up wont hurt lol sound quality is maintained till the maximum volume though it felt slightly that the mids succumbed to pitches at the apex verdict lack of decent bass extremely fragile design is unacceptable at price range of bucks for me not worth it details comparison happened to test the quality performance of all the renowned sennheiser hd ii over the ear headphone sennheiser cx in earphone lastly sony mdr xb ap in ear extra bass earphones bass sony senn hd senn cx the extra bass at sony may feel out of place at rare instances but never feels cheap redundant or unpleasant to the ears its quality refined timbre bass not some low quality stuff hd bass was ok but then it had other issues with sound leaking from the pads and disturbing others sound quality excellent on all but sony bit appealing with its phenomenal immersive bass build design again sony senn hd senn cx sonys wire were tangle free earphone pieces felt indestructible noise isolation was ultimate next was senn hd and least by any standards was senn cx the fragile design of the wires around mic in senn cx may itself be let alone discarding feature for many senn hd ii might be good for gamers and watching from distance with its long cord if leaking sound to outside world is not an issue bass is anytime better than senn cx but not as mesmerising as sony sound quality though is very good crisp and clear senn cx might be good for purists but even with its balanced highs and mids serious lack of bass keeps you longing for more especially if you are more into movies games and documentaries than music moreover its extremely fragile always tangling thin wires is constant annoying feature sony mdr xb ap gets the most evident and refined high quality deep bass with crisp high and quality mids its indestructible unique design offers the best noise isolation of all and comes with the most sturdy tangle free wires do not consider higher bass as an adulteration to pure music its quality bass with frequency response as low as to hz adds mesmerizing essence to the quality of sound which is absent on other two probably like super amoled with extra vivid colors that look more punchy full of life anyways at the end of the day its your call keep listening note there are thousands of reviews for this product but surprisingly there hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime also happen to use jbl si and sennhesiers cx so would be comparing all these earphones in this review you get shaped connector in these earphones so note that am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the best earphone in that subtopic built quality bo at flat cables which is tangle free in true sense metal housing holds up good but colour sheds off after months perfect shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting jbl small round cables shredding off after months of moderate usage plastic housing doing great so far connector is bent but not in perfect shape so its quite pain to use while resting sennheiser small round cables holding up good after year of rough use plastic housing has become slick as rubber coating on it has shredded off perfect shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting winner bo at comfort bo at comfortable enough when used while in upright position these are very uncomfortable when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so has very long earphone head jbl comfortable enough in upright position slightly uncomfortable using while resting as these have offset opening sennheisers comfortable in both the position these are apt for long duration usage winner sennheisers cx loudness cx bo at jbl cs si bo at tends to distort above level of volume jbl crystal clear even at full volume but has least sound level in all of three sennheisers tends to distort above level of volume but has greater sound level of all winner sennheisers cx sound quality bass mids lows noticed that all of them have almost same mids lows which are strong crisp but bass levels are different bo at has average bass am very disappointed with it since these earphones are marketed as bassheads jbl has least bass of all felt treble is high in these sennheisers ton of bass and when used proper eartips its just treat for bass lovers winner sennheisers cx sound quality over call bo at noticed in early few months quality over call was great but started to deplete after months but its still good not as good as new noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side jbl its quite average and has maintained the quality over year now sennheisers their no microphone lol pnote bo at jbl both mics works with android and os perfectly winner bo at customer care bo at year warranty had no issues till date so didn got chance to check it but some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences jbl year warranty had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within weeks after contacting nearest service center sennheisers years warranty had of these and one pair stopped working after year and half was replaced immediately within week after contacting nearest service center note first contacted the company via mail with my product details and was given all the required details for service would suggest this to all winner sennheiser cx connectivity all the earphones have mm connector and works perfectly with both android and os devices verdict don think need to explain anything else now since mentioned all the points of all these earphones to sum up would say bo at are good if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies if you want mic and even want to watch movies resting then go for jbl cs si but if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me then certainly go for sennheisers cx hope this review helps you make sound decision,positive

gifted it to my mother last month it was like love at first sip easy to use easy to clean easy to flex blessing for any indian adult still new to french press coffee so used south indian filter coffee for the past few weeks and could instantly feel the difference between cup of freshly pressed coffee and one of instant coffee although have been advised to try grinding my own beans for optimum enjoyment seep my grounds for around minutes after heating the press for around minute or so with hot water and am amazed at how heat resistant the glass is would however still advise taking precautions the markings inside also provide great measurement of how many cups would end up making not only have used it for making coffee but also to froth milk and to make tea attaching photos of coffee made using this french press with layer of frothed milk ngl one of the favorite purchases my family made am thoroughly pleased and highly recommend it to anyone time saving coffee filter been using this for many months now and it great love that it has line measurements only thing is wish the top surface had an arrow type bump on the plastic to point where the holes are you so you don have to look down but you can just tell by touch delivery amazon delivery is always reliable and it didnt fail me this time too packaging both outer packing and the product packaging were intact product packing had the right information and was very useful product very compact we used several coffee makers in the market but all required electricity to run we wanted to have non electric one which we can easily carry for outdoor and this one fits aptly to our requirements just add the coffee powder and hot water after while when we press the central pipe coffee comes out the nozzle makes it convenient to pour it cup for this price in great india sale think its worth am inclined to give star but reserving star now will use it for month and come back here to change my rating if it still satisfies me good one for black coffee lover very very happy with cafe jei french press it has become an important part of my daily ritual now in past days easy to use and maintain and would recommend buying without hesitation instruction manual could have been hard copy too much steps to get the ebook got this french press last year and another one few days back one for coffee another for green black tea totally value for money the built is solid and filtration is on point super happy,positive

good looking amd working fine brought this primarily because my lenovo laptop windows has only one usb port no ethernet slot and one connector port while in office immediately after purchase of this tp link ue port usb hub and gigabit ethernet adapter used this for the ethernet connectivity to my office network simultaneously was using the usb ports in the hub for connectivity of my wireless mouse and one port for external hard disk this continuously gave me problems with connectivity of the mouse or the hdd got errors like usb device not detected etc till point where it refused to detect my mouse at home used the hub for connecting only to my external hdds two numbers and it is working fine for moment was trying to return the product but since got this delivered in mumbai at my office and then had returned home to karnataka it refused to process return in different city right now it is working fine since do not need ethernet at home speed is more than wireless am not used since it restricted in my system have used it with hp and dell laptop its compatible with all its plug and play and easy to use good product it works perfectly trusted and reliable brand with convenient design having slot for folding the cable it works and works well every time however they made strange design decisions that take some points off the satisfaction of using of the product there is bright white light on the product which keeps flashing when the connection is active it is huge annoyance when im working at night the cable is flat which is like double edged sword on one hand it comes in handy when folding it on itself and redacting into the body but when its not hidden and used with laptop with the adapter being visible the flat cable folded sideways looks ugly the product wouldve been perfect if tp link didnt make these strange design decisions hope this helps thanks,positive

good mixer under noise level is slightly high but quite efficient product is ultimate super mixer quality was very nice bt juicers jar not up to the mark very noisy but works fine would have loved if it had extra bowl for that extra blade hectic to change blade into another bowl for using the extra blade suggestion one inverted jar would be nice too the juicer has the loose locking system all others have good locking systems some plastic from mesh was cut when using it that needs better alignment overall worth the purchase even with the excess noise also the screw tightener for changing blades broke after changes of blades but that is not big deal it would have been better to have durable nut tightener recommend to buy this good quality attachments and powerful watt motor not less than bosh grinder at less price had purchased active kw earlier from amazon but the item being imbalanced was returned for replacement the replacement piece received has the same defect which was returned for good then in view of the reviews went for this item and so far its performance is satisfactory although some of the reviews were discouraging if you want power as well as reasonable rates go for it very good item,positive

good one perfect one like its built charging power to my phone is adequate very good so far mostly like received today duracell charging cable depending on customers reviews and duracell brand purchased this cable but regret to say that charging speed is very very low charged my tablet and within one and half hour only percent charged not at all satisfied with the product the quality of wire and usb pin is good but it charge mobile little slow than the charger provided with mobile by oppo real me samsung was working well but suddenly stopped working within months of purchase best product,positive

good packaging wire quality is good very good quality but the wire is meters only at least should be meters for the price am using this with an as my satellite speakers wires were getting very flimsy out of the box these cables are very thick compared to the ones my speakers had before after replacing the cables with these ones noticed two things right away my speakers are louder the sound quality is much better one thing you wanna be careful is that these cables stick out like sore thumb in front of white walls so if you are like me who cares about the looks you might wanna cover these with cable raceways or even paint them like am planning to do wire is very best quality but cost not worth for it durability quality is absolutely good the product is gauge pure copper multi thread wires sound quality is impressive bears black band for ve ve distinction ve seen many reviews where people complain that this cable is not copper its aluminium and even some saying its fake so thought ll clear some doubts about this product its true this is not pure copper cable its copper clad aluminium infact most of the speaker cables are copper clad aluminium majority of the audio signal travel through the outer edge of the conductor skin effect hence the copper cladding thicker the cladding better the audio quality this cable only got thin cladding of copper the steel aluminium reinforced center is for more durable conductor now no where in the description amazon has mentioned that this is pure copper cladding cable so just need to get your expectations right you simply cannot expect oxygen free pure copper cable at this price rs you will not find decent gauge copper speaker cable for less than rs this is cheap gauge speaker and it does the job very well this cable is more than enough to deliver good sound to your speakers cable quality is average but you get what you pay for now if got some high end speakers then won recommend this cable good,positive

good product and superb fast heating as it was small tank if need to get bucket water on geyser and wait till water gets heated mins on tap and fill bucket with hot water off tap and wait for another round of water heating then again fill bucket and leave the tap on untill bucket filled with warm water if need more hot water repeat steps cons one need to purchase inlet outlet pipes which costs around as this was not provided by orient writing review after days usuage heater is so slow as compare to bajaj heater currently purchased this but it not good have ordered two of them installed in bathroom as well there is trick to use it in bathroom either turn tap really slowly or by turning on tap at full sppeed whenever the the water get cold again switch of the tap after to minutes again on and fill just this compromise you have to make in place of storage geysers product body fitting is average be prepared to spend another on installation pipes plug and installation charges no installation plate with geyser to be mounted on screws no safety valve supplied with geyser overall average product better go for havells which comes with all accessories easy to install temprature controller is not available with this product till date working good on th feb received as per delivery date on opening found that the unit is wrapped with plastic and found water droplets maybe they tested the product before delivery coming to the product it heats water to boiling temp in minutes and you can expect jugs of hot water only delivery packing since no bubble wrap or anything to protect the product product you should not design product with such low capacity now am struck after buying looks will update more later first of all this is not storage geyser this is instant water heater so better to understand the feature before using it just switch it on and wait for min it will start supplying hot water as told this is not storage geyser like ltr it comes with lts capacity only with kva so once the set temperature reach then open the hot water tap in normal slow running speed so that it will continue supplying hot water warm water if the hot water tap will be fully opened with full speed then this instant water water will not get sufficient time to warm the water hope this review will be helpful,neutral

good quality tempered glass best part is these guys are extremely prompt in customer service and warranty issues product quality good but over priced also there is small gaps from the edge but can be ignored got two screen guards for pro pro max installed only the one on the pro ive been used to fixing screen guards for multiple types of phones from multiple brand screen guards my honest review after the installation really liked how easy the installation was the coverage of the screen guard across the entire screen the finish of the product once installed hope to put an update after period of time on how the screen guard coped with my rough use good the product came well packed is durable infact much better than other organisations who try to sell you same stuff with inflated pricing the product stays on for long and has all the qualities to be called top product recently purchased screen guard for my smartphone and am extremely happy with my purchase the screen guard was easy to install and it fits my phone perfectly it has provided excellent protection for my phone screen and has prevented any scratches or damage the screen guard is made of high quality material and it is very durable highly recommend this screen guard to anyone who wants to protect their phone screen it is great value for the price and it has exceeded my expectations overall am very satisfied with my purchase and will definitely be purchasing from this company again in the future quality of the glass is good have been using it from last two months the scratch resistant coating works fine had issues with initial application of screen guard phone xs and then contacted customer support to get it resolved they immediately responded back and the issue got resolved am very much happy with the purchase and am planning to get another one for my samsung,positive

good quality works well it shows warp charge on phone when charging start only coz the charging is bit slower about than the original value for money good but not like original over all good product decent buy very good product value for money this cable bought in july end and in december mid it stopped working not durable and not value for money for rs of cable lasted hardly for months original one plus type cable cost around rs so went to have decent one but received this product with almost same as original will write once start using this for while but my first impression on this product is good it supports warp charge looks steady good built,positive
good service good like this product taste is also good worth for money product ok am updating my review hope it will get published and the who and who of the brand will pay attention to it after every two to three months the unit is having problem with the inlet system many times the inlet stops taking water but the indicator shows tank filling it was rectified by the service person again now the indicator showing tank filling while the inlet valve is shut it should show the purple light means low or no pressure it faulty unit the installation guy and the service persons were right who stated that the faulty and low quality units are sold online whose statement ignored thinking that every offline seller says so alas was wrong want this unit to be removed immediately and want my hard earned money back at this price this product is very suitable esy to install,positive
good sound quality surprising at this price in built acoustic sound nice bass is not overpowering good on ears instrumental details dialogues and background music chatter is also clear not harsh at all thumbs up looks are okay battery backup good do far bad noise cancellation is just hype used for in house calls couldnt block outside car noise horns even light switch on off noise kitchen noises cooking dish cleaning were audible on the other end mild ear pain after using for couple of hours bluetooth connection range is very low it starts to drop the audio beyond feet missing no battery status notification no auto off overall good for movies series music but not for office meetings phone calls everything is good but build quality is okay okay only thing liked is good battery and bass soundquality aand base quality is good good quality voice bass ok tremble very good,neutral

good to go overall good product good like this product very much as compared to other brand powerful motor is good product recommended for buying specifically juicer is good noise level is normal with comparison to other branded products at this price the juicer part seems badly designed as the fruit get stuck and only after half glass of juice you have it jammed and have to clean it don get this if you want juicer rest is pretty good the watt motor is very powerful and could grind sugar easily the juicer feels like gimmick to sell this at higher value very good,positive
good to use really good product in this price as compared to other expensive products does it job properly roller doesn come out if you scroll it properly adhesive is good in removing febric lints doesn come with cover but you can keep the used sheet wrapped till next use then you can remove it to get fresh sheet easy and handy works but adhesive could have been better it exactly as the pictures of the product the roller works well and does the job go for it if you need one have pets at home cats and need to use this everyday will definitely re purchase the roller and the frame is loosely tied and cuts hand every time use the whole roller disassembles quickly while in use the adhesion is not very good and finishes when rolled times ordered this because my pets hairs always stick on my clothes this product removes those hairs easily but in one jeans or shirt you need at least two sheets and also the roller comes down which make cuts on fingers so for cleaning really good but not at all easy to use easy to use can go for it,neutral
good use this to solve my numericals and its good excellent tool for kids in learning quality product good product product is amazing and less weight good use of it and can go for it good,positive
good using it for samsung fold with an ambrane charger fast charging works side on design is very practical sturdy build well worth the money very useful very nice in this price range the cable quality is great and its built well both sides are shaped connectors side of the cable should have been regular as shaper port blocks other ports and if you have mobile stand you can use this cable its very bad for data transfer even gb file takes or more minutes great for charging supports fast charging as well if you want cable just for charging your phone its great updating review after getting replacement now it doesn even fast charge my phone returned it product is good but sometimes there are little bit charging problem seen it shows disconnected from charging while it is plugged in btw some weeks later it eaten by our goat then bought one new best quality cable at best price short review go for it if you are looking for charging cable at or less sturdy and stylish with an added advantage of connectors deal price long review have been using portronics products lately and have to appreciate the quality and innovation they bring to the end users products own from portronics my buddy brillo power plate mobot one clamp konnect lall the products bought from portronics not just met my expectations but they performed beyond that it made me start building trust on the brand use ultra which can be charged at and this cable supports the same with the samsung original charger strongly believe the product would work at the rated power delivery it looks and feels sturdy and am expecting it to be durable too the ends keep the cables away without out interfering with the work space works the best when playing battle royale games as the cable won come in the way the grey and black colour combination works as charm and would blend in with apple devices data transfer speeds are yet to be tested will update here once have enough inputs on the same after using multiple cables from ambrane wayona wecool and more brands portronics definitely stands as good contender for all of them that serve the same purpose verdict would definitely recommend this type to type cable if you need to charge devices at or less,positive
good value for money this is really good quality cable its too long enough for modern tv units size works excellent with sony bravia tv perfect size and extremely good quality hdmi cable that gives arc connecting option purchased this hdmi to connect the setup box with my new samsung tv hz native unfortunately when used this wire to connect the picture quality was bad and was seeing red dots all over the picture when replaced with another hdmi cable all the issues were fixed so in short this procut was bad value for money good picture quality,positive

got it with intact packaging open it up the motor and jars were shining we have been using this mixer for few months and it works wonders have been using the dry grinder jar for grinding turmeric rice for my month old and chutney jar for different types of chutney we have used many other brands mixer but never had this powerful smooth working one should go for it mixer and pots quality are good but chuteney jar is of big size hence not good for small daily masala grinding should have provided small jar or option to select good very good product efficient working working very well without giving any problem excellent product this is such big name in my family and it holds the name true well packed and really good finish very happy,positive
got of this gb hp pendrives this morning review is based on testing done the same day summary the product is genuine and sturdy but the performance is just about average based on random file copy performance to fill the entire space pros cons comparing with san disk cruiser blade gb pros solid body looks and feels great read speed is fine mb product is genuine covered under year manufacturer warranty cons fits too tight in usb port thus causing more wear to the port and may even damage it if not used carefully capacity is gb precisely bytes not as advertised in windows it ll show up as gb drive compared to in sandisk no big deal just technical observation write speed mb is not bad but slightly inferior to its close competitor sandisk cruiser blade which easily gives to mb for the same test warranty is only years compared to years on sandisk but since almost nobody claims warranty after years and besides the plastic body of sandisk gets physically damaged in years anyway so it okay for me bottomline it good enough for casual users maybe chosen over sandisk for its look feel and sturdiness frequent users may want to look for better options with easier port fitting and better write speed details the product name is hp as shown on its packing the images in listing are correct while its part number is fd so slightly confusing but both are the same thing testing whether it is genuine or fake the bottom of the hologram sticker on the packing has silver layer with scratch and check written on it scratching it reveals digit code beneath it and the right edge of the sticker has the url to verify this code go to support product authentication page on that url that page contains instructions and explanation of the results that you may get mine were originals with the codes tested for the first time repeat test result will be warning that the code was tested before so that means it is covered under year manufacturer warranty as declared by hp for aisa pacific region design and build quality sturdy stylish but with design flaw it is exactly as shown in the picture the body is solid steel case with open front and the back sealed with black plastic cap the plastic back fits perfectly and gives it stylish look though it may come off later the hp logo product code etc are embossed on the steel body so likely won be erased with time overall it looks and feels great the flaw noticed was that it takes significantly more strength to push it into the usb port compared to other usb devices like generic usb cables or usual plastic pendrives like sandisk you almost have to fight with it to push it in or pull it out this means its frequent use can wear out the usb port too soon or may even break it if not used carefully capacity gb not will appear as gb in windows it is advertised as gb drive but the actual capacity is gb and yes fully aware of the decimal vs binary calculation difference hardcore linux user to be precise its exact capacity is bytes on both pendrives tested so in windows it will show up as gb drive in linux it will show up as either gb or gi binary calculation like windows for comparison my gb sandisk shows up as bytes or gb or gi this loss of gb in gb pendrive is no big deal for me just technical observation performance read speed about mb write speed about mb tested with collection of iso files ranging from about mb to gb along with few smaller files like pdf or txt total size of the collection was about gb gi did this testing on linux so to be fair the write performance may be slightly better on windows as it works better with fat that the pendrive comes formatted as edit no performance difference on windows either formatted as ex fat on windows to make it multiboot with yumi read write speeds were same while copying iso files to it or reading them to load in memdisk while booting could do more accurate testing with tools like dd command but didn bother as the difference usually isn very significant ups the product is very good mistakenly washed it washing machine with my pants but it is still running like new no data loss problem or data corrupt problems have faced yet downs the only downside is this pendrive is little slow because of technology is newer one and second one is not affact your data at all the silver paint on pendrive is vanishing time by time and it is now turning black product is good but slow storage is good but doesnt work for car stereo gb out of so far so good good product ok,positive
got this for at this price point believe the tv provides decent quality you shouldn expect amazing quality anyway from screen resolution the audio is also okay beyond the audio starts cracking from viewing distance of ft the quality looks good please note you will struggle quite bit to directly add firestick to the hdmi port they have given some other ports right next to the hdmi ports because of which the firestick doesn have proper space to fit properly unless you really shove it in there my suggestion is to get an hdmi extender for it overall say for small room it value for money satisfied with the product till now this led tv low budget good performance but picture audio not good is great but the installation guy asked me for paid installation misleading information but again for this price it good tv don pay installation guy you can do it yourself will give it stars out of bought this inch vw at after discounts picture quality and sound quality is good added firestick to it and it voila became smart tv the connections to attach these usbs are at the bottom part of the tv which is slightly different from other tvs so far working as it should revising this after days the tv is not responding to switch off button this is happening more when watch the tv for few hours and then when switch off the tv with the firestick remote the yellow colour indicator down below does not turn red instead it remains yellow as far as screen is concerned the tv screen changes to black whitish seems to me that the tv goes into hibernation or sleep mode this is fault of the tv as normal tv should swith off completely and the indicator should turn red have called technician tomorrow and if he checks and if he agrees then should get replacement as got still days time to replace it just helping note for people buying this tv if you are going to connect firestick to it as it asks for the brand name of the tv you can select vu and it will perfectly work on your firestick thanks and enjoy,positive
grand product good quality but not the best best used for backup or archive drives ve been using this since july and it has been quite helpful one can also put my internal drives and make it external making it easy for me to access my files format my drive or use it for some other purposes and orico products are really sturdy and well finished products its worth buying the product very easy to connect the hdd in the case just slide the cover and insert the disk plug the cable and you are ready speed is also very good the case is quite good in connectivity and transfer speed but the case body is made up of low quality plastic it is advisable to go for adata case have been using this for couple of days and am finally writing review for this item it works perfectly fine connected my years old laptop hdd through it and am getting about to mbps mega bytes read write speed previously purchased sata cable which promised usb but that did not give me more than kbps so this time made my choice and got this thing it works fine and easy to install my doubt is with the sturdiness will use for few months and update super light and really sturdy,positive

great product of convenience the only drawback being the heating or grilling time seems to be little more after regular use than it was when brand new but otherwise great product to reduce all the hustle came with small scratch on the casing and box was not sealed otherwise it ok pros good brand value two year warranty easy operation evenly cooked food decently priced cons weight distribution is not even tumble when press on handle cut off time is confusing mostly power cut before food is fully cooked there is no locking for griller no power regulator over all it good buy for domestic use the product is great but its size isn good not able to cook even jumbo bread sandwich in it the bread comes out of the griller and some part of sandwich is left uncooked works fine no issues am in love with this griller toaster it is so sleek and compact in design with complete ss finish for safety use food is cooked in minutes because of watt it is so good frequently grill my veggies paneer etc on this comes with auto cut feature to avoid food from burning good in griling its so fast griling but one problem power cord lenght is too short,positive
great quality overall in this price range bass is very low but not so low that it will feel bad more of balanced sound if you use any app to improve audio such as wavelet it will almost feel like premium quality some points to to note mic is available in both the buds but will work in only bud at time whichever bud you will pull from the box that only will work but if you use only bud then any one of it will work because any one of them can be used as master you can use only one any one of them at time and you can use it mic for call touch controls to receive or cut calls or else play pause music but this dynamic use of mic have some bug sometimes this change won happens properly and mic will not work or the other bud which is inside box may have active mic started so the person you are talking to will complain about voice is not coming or some time may be muffled audio put both buds inside box and then take out again to reset it and it will work again properly time faced error that even after putting both buds inside didn make them off and they continued connected to mobile connected box to charger and the issue resolved you can put bud inside ear and other hold in hand and keep close to mouth to get superior mic quality even in streets where lot of noise is or in the office where you need to speak in very low voice battery backup is almost same as claimed you can watch movies call for ling period and listen to song whole day without the need to charge the box if you put buds inside box inbetween for few minutes then you can really use it for day or easily overall the pods are good don know this piece is damaged or my system is lagging sound delay happens at any random but this sounds good good product worth it product giod for music or vedio but bad for calling not good as expected after few days left side earbud not working looking good but not working good have had boult wired earphones before and loved them but this is just way off the mark the case is flimsy it may look sturdy but it is light as feather the earphones themselves don connect unless you take them out of the case and even when they do there is pretty loud voice announcing it for someone like me who doesn put the volume up too high that voice is really irritating also have noticed that the audio cuts out sometimes have no idea whether that connectivity issue or something else in conclusion just go for something else this was bad one by boult nice product am not sure what to say it good for music but not useful for use for calls extremely non useful if you will speak anything the person other side hear anything,neutral
great watch good features easy and simple to use watch face is nice battery life is decent last for days sensors work well smooth controls and display is bright only issue is that after the watch came into contact with water it started malfunctioning power button not working bluetooth calling doesn work and battery gets quickly drained despite having bluetooth off have recently bought this product and was not so happy and not worried as advertised this smart watch meets its purpose descent size and medium weight to wear always few of my suggestion to become better watch touch response can be improved touch accuracy is less resolution can be still more better need to click on the button to see time or to awake instead of pressing button should have give touch to awake can have provide some more option like finding phone and finding smart watch product is good worth the money there is bit snag in wakeup mode while moving hands it takes time to on the screen automatically overall good performance battery backup not good worst watch only day it will come if you charge bought it months back working fine call quality is good dont expect great touch sensitivity found good and product finishing and features are super the product is good with good battery life nice product but the touchscreen and app could have been better,positive
had an lg monitor and broke it twice while wiping with cloth it couldnt even take my ring figure pressure first time repaired it with huge cost but second time had to throw it then bought this one slightly smaller as was afraid not to pay too much lg had in built speaker but this one does not there is no speaker mike the picture quality is good have dell soundbar for audio mic so that is covered the brightness is too much at but can reduce it to which is good enough for me the monitor includes power chord and hdmi cable it has nice sturdy stand the build quality is good the viewing angles are also good with no glare from room lighting overall the picture quality is quite good the monitor also has eye care settings there are couple of separate screws provided in plastic cover so be careful while unpacking had no missing screws problem have been using for my personal and office work it good product when you like to splitting the screen and work simultaneously in two different windows the experience is far great came with the just the oem package slapped with invoice but the product was safe pros inch screen pixels are small enough can see it if try but not bad ips bleed is not there but there is definitely ips glow but not that bad hz but meh can tell the difference but again have hz phone so makes no sense to buy it for hz colors are good movies and games pop out well comes with hdmi cable which is neat build it good and angle of the monitor can be moved cons has like slight yellow tint just like the redmi phone but could get used to it hz is gimmick no display port which so bad ips glow is there not much but dark things will look grey game mode is useless and eye blinding the power cable has adapter with it which is pretty fragile if it break ur monitor is brick verdict would say don buy this just for the hz it not worth it would be looking into benq and lg monitor or go big and get higher refresh rate monitor wouldn say this was waste of money but this definitely expensive for wat it offering pros good display quality that the end of pros cons why on god green earth there is no audio jack what is the use of hdmi port if user can get video and audio both if someone is investing on monitor why in anyone will need vga port build quality is questionable entire build is made of plastic which is fine but for me monitor was always little tilted no matter how hard screwed the stand it was still the same amd freesync isn much affective you can still see screen tearing stand movement is very stiff almost felt like broke it just bad build quality if you are only going to use hdmi port and find workaround for audio then alright but for someone who games on pc and console both this is not good enough if you are willing to sacrifice little bit of visual quality and hz of refresh rate which is not noticeable at all then go for ben same price but less hassle or better bump up your budget go for lg mk which goes for or less but worth it it could have one more hdmi port monitor for editing and casual gaming,positive
had been using logitech mk for couple of years before couple of keys started getting iffy no spills or accidents with an overall positive impression of logitech performance compared to my experience with similar from dell hp decided to try the slightly cheaper and compact mk while knew this would be more compact with fewer keys feel should highlight the disadvantages can see immediately especially for users of full size keyboards at work refer image while my hands will get used to closer keys they also seem much less springy lower overall size is also too small to place on one lap and type which could with the other wireless keyboard especially during wfh big point is the much larger size of the dongle this will need to be removed and stashed carefully at home every time throw my laptop into my bag for meeting never did this for mk and simply kept dongle fixed forever to my laptop usb port that dongle also had slot inside the mouse for safekeeping which is not there in mk neither mouse nor keyboard has switch off mk had switch on both mk mouse takes aa whereas mk takes battery mouse is shaped different lower arch and wider which may simply take adjusting feels little cheaper while real review can only be provided much later seeing how keys clicks perform over the long run and one hopes that logitech will have taken care of that quality while don have any complaints so far feel paying bit extra for the mk may suit many folks out there hope the review helps will update later if see find any fundamental issues with time product is good but lagging very much not enjoying satisfied with this product bad for me it is working fine till now the keyboard is good but pretty small when compared with regular keyboards it works well and keys and ok excellent go fot it good product handy just connector is little bit big size works properly initially noticed lag and then looked it up online it seems usb receiver faces interference when another port next to it is plugged in to other device had the lag of both mouse and keyboard actions but noticed that my usb receiver was plugged next to hdmi port which was also connected to monitor switched the usb receiver to another usb port on other side of laptop without any neighboring ports don face lag now try to use usb hub if you don have usb port away from existing used ports build quality and all are good but the batteries cap is little bit loose for the keyboard and mouse is totally fine,positive

had zero expectations when bought it neither disappointed nor am happy the most important flaw there are times forget to switch it off it stays switched on throughout if you have big palm then it is going to give you aches after few hours of use rest is all good product is fine at this cost it smooth its good wireless mouse but sometimes lags when do heavy tasks like video editing it doesn have sleep feature led glows all the time don have low battery indicator light best mouse nice good working as it should be no issues with reception and latency,positive

hassle free and easy to use it good and it does it work swiftly disadvantage is its max temperature range it could attain is less feel but never got burnt sandwich with this one all are good only you need to take care about heat and cutoff time of light otherwise your sandwich will burn it very nice product even though the temperature control is not that great you have to preheat it before the cord is too big for my liking but it fine there are some cons its top gets very heated when are using it have to preheat it it takes time to cool which is big thing overall product is fit would recommend so it would be stars if it had nice temperature control the grill overall is nice but they could improve and huge thing the lights given above it turn red and yellow it should be green since yellow means waiting and stuff and in the beginning thought the same thing and my sandwich burned the wires at the back get heated up as well which can cause fire and is dangerous we are useeing currently this product as per accepted this is good product nice,positive

have been using this for about six months now it is quite handy and is able to make pretty good fruit shakes and smoothies add couple of ice cubes and it manages to crush them but needs more than one cycle battery life is acceptable charge after every uses the motor runs at full all the time thought that would be able to tell when the battery gets low but no it will simply stop at the last second with no way to tell if it is getting low initially wondered if the exposed charging port would lead to any problems or not but have been careful with it and have had no issues find it to be great and useful product for one person get proper non portable blender if you want to use it for blending hard dry substances or for multiple people easy to use best blender used so far great product very compact and easy to carry cant blend hard items but works for soft fruit smoothies or milkshakes we liked this product build is solid and the motor is powerful enough for its purpose it would have been perfect if the charging port was not exposed good one satisfied am using this product since weeks it is good upto now am using this for only milk shake with banana only its blending is good,positive
have been using this geyser for almost two months it heats up the water in just minutes and quite power efficient uses almost half unit for two person and if you leave it on for the whole day its around unit very power efficient and looks stylish in the bathroom and due to the form factor doest take much space go for it you get all the pipes and installation material in the box so no need to buy them separately which is the case in some other models had option while purchasing this geyser havells vs this one opted this one as this was cheaper then its havell counterpart but this geyser does not satisfies me at all the only pros is its heats up water very quickly but rest is all cons keep the know to maximum temperature but still the light does not move from orange to red even if put on the geyser for hrs it does not holds hot water for long have used recold ao smith even amica earlier they were not as quick as crompton but they used to hold hot water for long have another havells at home whose light goes from green to orange to red to display water temperature paisa wasul hai the product is not that good just given star energy efficient but it takes more time to heat the water also dont holds hot water for atleast hrs temperature control also not so good after getting liters itself water becomes cold even if it is on from min im using ao smith geyser in our one room from five years no issue again purchased geysers for other two rooms one is ao smith and other is this crompton even though spend more for this geyser im not satisfied better go for ao smith or racold waranty card are missing good product using since months working properly,positive
have been using this mouse for like months and this is the best mouse under the mouse has the basic gaming stuff like extra buttons dpi settings but the main thing is the software like you can customize so much on this mouse the rgb is fully customizable you can set many macros you can revamp the keys and also change the dpi values these features usually come in expensive gamming mouses but this is very good for this cheap the design is also very good and one thing you should note before buying is that this mouse is big like it is big as my hand so if you got small hands you should think twice but it doesn affect that much got the hang of it in like week it doesn come with any warranty so thats con but part of it everything is so good really would recommend this mouse is very good for gaming the high dpi sensor on this mouse is very good their is no drifting the rgb is very goodi have used this mouse for about months and its still intact no problem with scroll wheel or side button the software provided by redgear is also very great and has lots of features mostly used this mouse for fps games like csgo valorant overwatch but the side buttons also help in building in fortniteonly issue is the build quality some party feel kinda lose its my first gaming mouse but damn its so good the grip is perfect and dpi is also good at this range you shoud go for it if you get it under rupees no words just excellent accuracy top notch feeling while in hande is awesome feels very big in hand very comfortable to hold for long time design is very good nice mouse love it decent mouse with ecent price if you are buying this mouse exclusively for gaming don cause the polling rate is no different than lets say cheap dell mouse you see at work exact polling rate of this mouse is hz which is very low if you want precise aiming in competitive but the redeeming feature might be the looks the rgb looks cool but you cant use just one single color it feels great in hand but my thumb has to pull back lot to press the lower side button but that can be attributed to my long thumb the cables braided too so there that verdict great value is you can get it for around rs considering its looks and other subtle features fine mouse for what it worth,positive
have been using this phone for two months according to the price range the battery backup and screen quality of the phone are good according to this range the camera is also fine if we look at the performance then it is not useless at all but it is okay did not face any problem in calling the phone starts lagging lot while browsing or using shopping apps if give my opinion then this phone is good for parents if you want to buy this phone then you should compare it with poco for now there is not much difference in the price all is well but sim slot damage it is very good phone on this price range good to use in day today life use hi good budget phone bought this for office use has good battery life and basic features of android work fine however noticed later that this is actually android go edition don mind using it but some features are missing which most people might not use better than nokia which has android go edition and on website there is not mention of any update so on budget of you can definitely but this one nice features budget phone like this product,positive

on your mobile search for devices and you ll find boult audio just tap it and you ll be paired also you can hear an audio that your are being connected battery the company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery it states that it has hours of playback yes the battery backup is good on this we can easily get hours of play time through this earphones additional features these earphones come with built in vibration whenever you receive call the earphones will start vibrating have to tell you the vibration os really strong and can easily be know even if you are in busy like traveling in bike or busy street but remember if you re getting calls continuously it ll less the battery backup sound quality sound quality in these earphones are amazing the mids are crisp and clear the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it that not punchy but don you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base the call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone these earphones have noise cancellation which works good the volume level on these earphones are really high cannot go beyond alright so have been using boult pro bass curve for over month and would like to summarize my feedback in bullet points to make it easy for the prospective buyers was thinking to buy quality bluetooth headset with great performance at an affordable price for quite long and this is where my search ended was quite fed up of using cheap wired headsets as they used to go out of function or get snapped every now and then moreover found them getting entangled every other second making it really inconvenient to handle especially while travelling its that time started feeling the need of wireless headset and began my search took good time months to look for good product and this is when decided to purchase this item before purchase devoted time to read the user reviews that always do before making any purchase small or big and found myself convinced finally decided to go for it ok so no more essay writing let me get straight to the key points bought this for under sale so saved inr it good saving as warrent buffet says every penny saved is every penny earned this has great sound quality could not compare it against any other product because don have any other bluetooth headset with me but this will surely not let you down it is very loud even at volume level you just cannot listen to at that level forget about full volume bass is great but not outstanding to be honest but it does not disappoint either good thing is the sound does not distort even if you raise it to excellent sound clarity am not technocrat so cannot tell what are the characteristics of noise cancellation feature but you will not get to hear any external sound noise or very very minimal that is not noticeable so this stands perfect at this point performs excellent while taking call you will get crystal clear voice when you make take call using this device you will feel as if you are making calls directly from the mobile phone in fact it even better at times when the voice from the other side is low really love the hands free calling because have to take long calls with the clients in my job battery backup is excellent it can last anywhere from to hours have tested it rigorously in both audio and video usage and mean it tested it for almost month with day wise log capture please see the detailed tracking at the end it gets full charged in hours approx bluetooth range is good it covers distance of to feet easily it quite enough if not good enough my figures may be wrong beware it just my rough estimate haven tested is rigorously design looks good and is very convenient to wear the wires are adjustable as per need this is nice thing looks cool when you wear it around your neck chose red color last but not the least it comes with year replacement warranty so you can sleep peacefully while enjoying your favorite music judgement just go for it if you have limited budget or don want to spend fortune on bluetooth headset was hesitant to spend anything beyond bucks on bluetooth headset it was my personal limitation ps battery backup log may hour minutes

headphone recommend for this one under rupees best one no battery backup and no flexible to use they don satisfied with provided features am writing this review after used of days the product is really very good sound quality durability battery performance is also very good overall its fair product rs with all the features its perfect for daily commute since it has very good battery life it will last for to days easily when it comes to the sound quality feel its not delivering as advertised which is obvious it would be wrong to expect great sound from an overall product you cant have everything at once this is my personal opinion since am music enthusiast and have experienced music from great headphones and ear phones other than that its worth trying totally recommend this product if you daily travel for work and you are looking for budget wireless earphone sound quality is not best liked this product already using since few days battery back is also very good,neutral
have just received the product within one day delivery service was very fast the product is economical and works well have already used other product from lifelong brand and they worked perfectly so really happy with this brand my mom loved it it tiny but super performer producing heat upto or mt room can get heated up with in min value for price paid it working good so far st day hardly used it week and notice dark bands on the elements very comportable to use but defect of safety device is an issue,neutral
have lot of cables running between my soundsystem settop box tv and between my routers accesspoint it was kind of messy before organized it using insulated thin metal tie cable but when open it to add more cables or remove cable it was broken and not looks good also was afraid that tightening the tie cable may cur the wire since it was so thin and insulation is also very thin but after use this it looks so neat and it is easy to remove or add more cable whenever required adhesion of wellgrow is good overall like this product suggest dont to precisely cut the wellgrow add some of extra length which will allow to add more cables in future if needed all was good but received pieces instead of since have used already not going to return it just requesting the sellers to deliver as promised other than that the product is great and works great not only wfh setup but also if you re dealing with lot of wires this is the way to go good quality good quantity and quality sticks tightly and easy to strap helpful for keeping wires organized at work table laptop charger mobile charges etc had to bind together variable number of wires at different places and this worked great without any wastage useful to organize wire little expensive but don have time to find it in my locality and quality is also good these are strong and better than plastic tags which you normally use to keep wires in order these can be removed and reused they are also very strong as they are supporting my bluetooth soundbar which have hung up in my room,positive
have pd supported car charger and bought solimo cables previously which work perfectly fine but this one doesn trigger full fast charging unlike solimo usb to usb which is strange because this is supposed to be charger with fast charging support anyways it good built product and works but not as expected it might be compatible with your chargers but tested different car chargers and both didn go full speed,neutral

have purchased it for my galaxy watch mm it fits perfectly and the touchscreen works good but packaging should improve am writing this review after using the product for month nice case for samsung watch no touch problem faced till now best thing about this case is it comes with warrenty so that you can replace it if any defect product you received fells hard plastic lookwise it good there is an air gap between the screen and the case which means it made for thicker body which means it made for the watch classic you have to press hard on the screen guard so you actually touch the screen do not buy for watch otherwise it should be ok for watch classic though cannot confirm the case has integrated screen protector and protects the sides obviously it doesn cover the back the blue looked weird on my black watch overall from protection perspective the product is very good look is good only the touch screen sensitivity needs to improve product for samsung watches,neutral
have purchased two of them had to pay rs per piece checked the price in local shop next door the same brand same watt same piece was available at the shop for rs my return window got closed till then buy this product from your local shop like product value for money it is really nice one there are two things need to tell you it doesn fit to normal socket you need to have bigger sized socket the other one for pulling it back from power socket there is not sufficient grip that is only the drawback thank you heating water value of money nice using this from last year no complaints yet nice product plug not suitable for normal swich board in india need adapter for that,positive
have received this product with torn packet missing cable and user manual it seems incomplete product and the same airtel sim gives me strong network but here foud it slower than my mobile network it fine it might be the problem of network but the cable shouldn be missing it seems someone taken while shipping because got the packet broken however received the wi fi with battery and use my own cable to charge it overall satisfied nice working faced much tower problem it is better than mobile hotspot but it battery backup is not good even with sim the network speed is really low and connection is patchy its ok if you are using it for personal surfing but not good fit for office work satisfied with the product when connect only device then ok but when multiple device connecting it is hitting abnormally within minute then backup reduce maximum hours,neutral
have used boat boat boat and go for st time with zeb thunder pro actually im music lover and expect more sound quality bass thump and rich music feels trust me below what quote here boat is budget segment wired type less than rs its overall massive performance looks quite simple but gives extra bass overall worth and boat rs is discomfort because of over tight pressure in ears hope by long days its become loose by the sound its gives pinch more than extra bass than boat and looks smart here sound is more and bass thump is very more but here voice or somewhat looks bassy not suitable for online classes its only use for music lover boat is around rs its only suitable for online classes for voice no thump or bass at level totally very mild sound with clear vocal dont expect bass or beat here and met agreat issue is its over ear headphone and its make sweat my ear and make my body temp increase now zeb thunder pro rs for this price its great product classy look sd slot and so but here some negative points also here buttons or not sturdy some what loose and body parts are like head band are toy plastic for music full volume is very loundness not lovely to like make shout punch in ear painfull bass is also very good but overall its always below tha boat products im not hatter but if used boat product wont like it same that if use sony wont like boat if use no other brands and zebronics st time become lover to this still im surprise how they give this product for this price shocking aux type under is shocking bcoz if go for boat type product is above zeb or not bad its more ok for this price sound heavy loud in full voume looks shouting inside ear otherwise nice bass not reach boat product but wont feel diff if use for more days music sound vocals cant separate in this product durability bcoz they used toy plastic in band but however not easily breaks compare to boat its strong only overall look for aux type best bass effect so at last above all are not reach my concern now ordered zeb bang pro rs if it also sound loud thing then shutdown with boat rs segment note if get boat in initially wont go for these alllllll bcoz unbeaten and full fil my all expect thanknu sound quality is good built quility is ok as per pricing got it for rs totally worth it its been more days since am using its working totally fine sound and other qualities are doing well except ear cuffs are getting detached easily and no firm support for them pons they are good for the price they come sound is decent battery life is long enough for days not countinously the wired features is charm if battery goes dead noise cancellation is also decent coming to the bad points build quality is little cheap according to the price the hinges shouldn be used that much it will lose it grip also the bluetooth is not that grt if you are on vehicle and connected your phone you will hardly hear any song the connectivity is issue the dual connect is good but their is latency of about second when switching from one to another that all you can buy this if your budget is less and as student this is the best headphones at this price range sound great bass vocal and instrument seperation average to be expected like this for this price connectivity fast bt connection bt disconnects when aux connected comfortable to wear since its over the ear average build quality overall like this product use it everyday while travelling to college far away places if you are getting this product within rupees then it is good product for you it is overall nice product,neutral
have used it for week now on daily basis it good product for normal use it great you can use it with ease for game also it is usable but it littel bit on heavy side its unnoticeable if you are not that habitable to play games sleep mode is good feature which helps to save battery and you don have to worry about killing the switch whenever you leave the pc nice product value for money this mouse is very noisy and small too have returned this mouse because got better product of quantum with keyboard which satisfies me also this mouse package doesn contain any battery so you should care and think twice before purchasing this product nice product so far it working smooth good product at this price but after falling down it gets broken good for basic use not for gaming like this product,neutral
have used it mainly for boiling water knob turned maximum to right so cannot comment much about lower temperature settings it takes about min for water to boil suggest mfr to release in other colour like light blue etc as see some other kettles it may add to the looks and give warm feeling in the room the stainless steel looks shiny but the material is not very thick but it ok for the price there may be formation of scaling or white brownish spots on the base of kettle in shape due to the shaped half coil at base funny design maybe product created by modifying higher wattage full circular coil kettle the scales are more when tap water is used due to higher presence of salts maybe they seem to get cleaned by usual scrubbing given wide based cylinder shape it is very easy to clean to be aware the kettle does not auto shut off when water boils similarly the kettle temperature will be kept warm at knob setting unless the knob is at the leftmost when it shuts off else the water will keep drying out until it dries out completely and then the kettle is supposed to auto shut off to prevent dry heating haven tested this though these are mentioned in the manual so this can be thought of as warmer boiler so you cannot leave the kettle unattended thinking that it will auto shut off like other kettles when the water has started to boil assume this is designed this way to allow bit of cooking for those who want to use it in that manner accessories cannot fathom what the use is of the plastic bowl provided given that plastics can leach chemicals when heated would not suggest to use it inside the kettle in any way steaming steel rack is given too that could be used alongwith some steel plate with holes for steam cooking but there is none provided with the product itself final verdict if you are ok with somewhat slower heating kettle but with more versatility and easy to clean at reasonable price this will do the job if similar product was available with higher wattage at higher price would have bought that instead wanted to give star rating because agaro forces its customers to give rating and review to get the warranty it is bad practice you cannot force customer to give rating as mentioned it may result in the product having negative rating on amazon despite being good product in my opinion the product itself is good it heats water very fast it is good for making maggie pasta and boiling eggs but need to be careful while making maggie or pasta because once they get dry they start to stick to the bottom the kettle is very easy to clean the cord length should have been longer one issue that noticed that only one half of the base of kettle generates heat everything is good it has been very useful for me there is only one drawback guess the heating is not uniform across the base of the kettle since whenever boil milk or make tea coffee portion of one side bunrs the milk even while boiling water can see the similar symptom agaro multicooker is good and gives variety of cooking boiling options like milk tea eggs maggi etc only negative point is that agaro team promises extended warranty of months by giving asking to give positive review on amazon but fails to deliver on their promise and does not give any extended warranty delivery has safe got item safely delivery on time instantaneous water boiling sufficient space big volume best for hostel students hope for warranty and company response liked how fast it does the work but hate about the dirt it gets inside after cooking something it sticks their overall gorgeous product the most beautiful thing is that the cord length is big that is better option for your kitchen and aslo that is the best option for hostel users liked the design and operation however cord length could be longer temperature control is good but knob need some modifications overall happy with this product,positive
have used multiple air fryers but this one is best and value for money good product and excellent demo was given by manikandan on video call however we returned this to get higher version of this it good product worth the money the virtual installation and demo given by manikandan was very helpful and made it easy to use easy to use easy to clean easy to maintain good product value for money must recommend to everyone thanks lot this airfryer as expected is an alternative for people who hate deep frying and oil less food not only that instant pot could be better than other airfryers out in the market manikandan gave demo of the product thank you very good explanation about product and it function then safety precautions and clarify our doubts by manikandan and this demo was very useful to us nice product user friendly got video session for demo installation given today by zafar he explained all the options very well ready to support even after demo am giving star for product installation this airfryer is most satisfying compact not over sized and easy to clean was worried it will be too large worth the cost,positive

havent used any other battery pack so will not be able to provide the exact expected performance simply put it is not divide by the battery size of your phone will be the expected cycle times if consider this as measure then would say that the battery capacity is around mah happy with the product but its very heavy day by day battery life is reducing remaining parameters are good slim easy to carry for travelling very good looking very satisfied with this product overall good but it takes to hours to charge very heavy must be about kg very quick charge takes ages almost hrs to fully charge charged my samsung twice once full charged recently purchased the mi power bank ah and have been extremely impressed with its performance have personally tested it with laboratory equipment and have found that it has capacity of around ah which is very good compared to other power banks on the market one of the things that appreciate about the mi power bank is that it is able to hold its charge for long period of time have not had to recharge it as frequently as have had to with other power banks in terms of durability the mi power bank has held up well over time the construction is solid and the power bank has not suffered any damage despite being carried around in my bag on daily basis overall am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the mi power bank ah and would highly recommend it to others it is reliable and high quality power bank that delivers on its advertised capacity,positive

here is try at review of this product after using it for an year now use case am ncr resident and the air pollution is as we know one of the worst possible if not the worst have it installed in the bedroom about sq ft so well within the advertised max room space while using the purifier the room is kept closed to minimize pollution addition build quality the purifier is sturdy in its built and aesthetically pleasing it has large front grill that acts as the air inlet and an arched back that has larger grill for filtered air outlet the arc helps the air to be released vertically upwards and hence does not add to direct cooling for anyone sitting in front this helps the filters use in winter which is the main season where it is required the top of the filter has dark panel with touch sensitive buttons and decent sized circular led screen the buttons are power night mode fan speed and child lock setup the air purifier is shipped with its parts packed separately thus on unboxing the same has to be setup for use the setup is pretty straightforward the main filter units front can be released and the individual filters aligned in order on the central space the installation order of the filter is as follows first hepa filter the same has indication on top to correct installation you can also go with keeping the phillips branding on the top left corner second active carbon filter the same has indication on top to correct installation you can also go with keeping the phillips branding on the top left corner third pre filter this one actually clips in place and is used to filter out the larger dust impurities so that it does not clog the other main filters thus the filtering order is pre filter carbon filter hepa filter working the air purifier can be set to different modes one of them being the automatic mode that automates the purifier working thanks to the inbuilt air quality sensor the pollution level sensed regulates the fan speed accordingly levels are programmed and are indicated on the small circular led screen by means of circular rings of different colors blue min violet pink red max red level would put the fan in maximum speed and blue would turn off the filter automatically if you are not fan of the automatic mode you can use the fan speed button to move through the option of different fan speed modes they are fan speed indicated by on the screen fan speed indicated by on the screen fan speed indicated by on the screen automatic mode indicated by on the screen allergen mode this can be only added on top of automatic mode it essentially bumps up the speed bit on all the different color levels this is to suit the sensitive people as this improves the air filtration rate turbo mode indicated by on the screen this puts the fan in the maximum speed possible thats pretty much the major functioning of the air purifier additionally the filter has an automatic forced night mode the purifier automatically detects the lighting in the room and once it senses low to no light it automatically goes into night mode the same can be forced by pressing the night mode button the purifier what this does is that if the filter is in automatic mode the fan speed is reduced on all the levels so as to minimize the noise summary so as to summarize my review and add my view here the filter works pretty well for the use case have on regular winter pollution days its able to keep the air quality in control even when working in automatic mode its able to go down from red levels to blue switching on an off intermittently as per the air quality levels on drastic pollution days it has tough time managing the air quality in automatic mode and have to force it in turbo mode to get the air quality in control if not too much of an air change is happening in the room throughout the filter is able to get the air quality to much acceptable levels the air quality indicator is great value add on to the product much that is missing in similar priced competitors am little disappointed in the night mode working as it compensates air quality over noise believe the purifiers task is to ensure that the air quality in room is as good as possible by reducing the fan speed to reduce noise works ok on normal pollution days but is totally useless in any thing even little worse when dont want to use turbo mode just yet durability of the filters has been decent have used it all through the winters last year and intermittently the summer this year but am yet to get an indication to change the hepa or the carbon filter on yes that reminds me the air purifier would automatically sense and indicate when filter needs to be replaced by displaying an error code on the screen it even does that for the pre filter which does not have to be replaced but just cleaned washed that have received times this past year overall still strongly recommend this product good performance with decent price which has been slashed good amount from when it launched good product the product does not stand out notably but it probably does the work it is supposed to it is too late now to return this product and try another make over all good product easy to install well designed product yet to experience filter replacement and consequently the recurring cost the product is working nicely and worth buying product writing after almost years all pros cons everything is good only problem is live in delhi and hepa filter will cost you around and it took only months it become totally black few advice dont run it near kitchen it will catch all carbon pores will blocked if you live in delhi check it after every month clean with vaccume cleaners seal your doors most dirt mosquito come from there open windows only that too seal them and put anti dust and mosquito net on them run it all day as when turn it iff after hour your room will be as dirty as ut was you can clean pre filter only don clean carbon and hepa filter being and indian if your hepa filter become black get some jot water put some detergent and dip it inside all dust and carbon will come out and use it again haha its paper but its so hard you can wash it times keep it under sun light for hours sometimes get error of fo clean all three filter with vaccume or brush careful while cleaning with brush that dust is dangerous can cause problems so wear mask after cleaning hold ur finger on child lock to reset and it will start working bhai delhi pollution bhot so family lie monthly rs padta filter mother wife bachy pura din gher rhty so its must buy to protect them update fan speed got slow down power consumption on st watt nd watt rd watt max watt best is keep it on automatic mode when room will be clean power consumption will reduced to watt and whole night it work in power efficient mode do not left your room door or window open it will continue to be red room should be closed room is still dusty not much functional,positive
hi all firstly was very skeptical to purchase tv through online secondary iam big fan of sony and lg brands thirdly as have year old kid at home was so scared to spend money beyond ofcourse at the first day sale for prime members when the amazon great indian festival started saw one plus and hisense were priced at under including bank offers and my favourite sony inch was priced at but discarded sony just bcz of expensive and scared if my kid whilst playing will break it so was continuously searching for budget friendly tvs like tcl redmi nokia and iffalcon but didn like the inch tv suddenly out of the blue on thursday that is on october saw this blowing offer on hisense vivid tv but scared to buy but felt offer was tempting so took the risk and bought it for deal price icici bank credit card instant discount so technically bought it for so felt worth the risk and bought it on nd october tv was delivered to me and immediately raised installation request and technician came on october and installed the tv that my journey from searching to installation now coming to initial impressions picture say being va panel can clearly see blacks are not so deep they are bit of greyish kind however colours are not over saturated felt they are normal and when looked at tv from sides can clearly say it doesn come near to ips panel display but yeah for an average user like me it sufficient remote it simple major apps hotkeys are given yt amazon prime video hotstar which is good voice assistant is enabled simple and user friendly experience it lacks hands free google assistant sound personally felt if watts audio given in the tv it would have been great but only watts given which is crisp and clear though increased volume upto to chk but no distortions nothing it clear dialogues and bass but if soundbar is added it will be added advantage ui it comes with android it doesn matter to me as very average user so runs the show for me hope hisense sends the ota update now to the main point as can see my pictures see specially in amazon prime video app on the blue screen there are some lines which don know whether it problem with panel or application need to chk with amazon customer service for the reason if any user can help or enlighten me on this issue that would be super conclusion frankly speaking bought this tv only bcz got it almost under bought for including extended warranty for years bcz even if some mishap happens when the kids playing it won pinch me so from my perspective felt it okay with some minor issues like sound just need to get clarity on that prime video issue if that is sorted will be happy happy diwali to team have bought this tv at and at this price tag its great purchase picture quality is good not at per with sony or lg tv but better than its rivals like mi redmi vu etc va pannel works fine and gives good amount of blacks pros android tvsound colour cons remote loved the picture quality average picture quality but ok for this price worth for the cost nice quality and clarity good good product good support team as unit reached within hours installation done within time of installer called demo properly given and company call also received in days for confirmation of material delivery and installation done proper way,positive
hi guys bought this yesterday so havent used it much so an early review but the most detailed review so please read till the end very important points are mentioned looks are cute it looks really nice and elegant am using it with mac book air so far it seems there are no problems using it the scrolling is smooth connection does not drop and there is no lag connection is instant there is no pairing required it plug and play along with the dongle provided with it it sits low on the table feels weighty but not in wrong way the battery adds to it weight but have used heavier mice before and this one feels just right it has good grip nothing to complain about that buttons are nice and clicks are satisfactory not too noisy they are just right scroll wheel doesn feel cheap at all though believe it could ve been better quality body is matt finish and doesn leave fingerprints on it though if you re someone who eats and handles the mouse then it ll show the oil prints and that true with any peripherals the mouse doesn feel cheap overall but it is definitely plasticky though not in the bad sense it is definitely not cheap looks wise there is an on off switch on the bottom which is helpful in saving the battery which is included when the mouse is not in use there is no light on the bottom which is good if you have kids in the house who keep flipping the mouse and staring at the super bright light so that good thing and definite plus the overall shape and size works in the favour of the mouse and variety of users with small and large palms will be satisfied with it now over to major flaw the mouse connects only though it own usb dongle which by the way comes tucked inside the body of the mouse itself inside the battery door which found mighty impressive and not through the laptop bluetooth now this means two things you have to carry around the usb dongle with you everywhere you go which means if you happen to forget it at home while traveling and carry just the mouse then the mouse is pretty much useless in that scenario and worse still if you happen to carry it out of station with you and bring back only the mouse and forget to pack the dongle then you re stuck and don think you get only the dongle you ll have to check that with the seller and then the mouse is left useless in that case now over to the problem am facing which did not see anyone else mention in their reviews use mac book so it doesn have usb inputs which means you must buy connector for it to connect the dongle actually had already bought connector so that was not problem for me but you will have to factor in the cost of the connector which is not cheap because you want to buy only good quality connector for your expensive mac book of course that is problem with the mac book and not with the mouse but consider this point it is very important it will not connect over mac book bluetooth otherwise it works well with the mac book the only caveat found is the tracking speed on level is too slow and on level is too fast you ll have to get used to that thing it doesn feel very natural as the trackpad on the mac book feels because of that speed problem but otherwise the pointer flows smoothly on screen and doesn jump around at least with my mouse also the battery door does make noise when landing the mouse on the pad and feel it could have been made better but guess at the cost you really can complain too much overall think good buy but the compulsion of having to use it with it own dongle is major drawback feel if that doesn bother you then nothing else should keep you from buying this product especially since it is one of the cheapest wireless mice out there at less than bucks which is what it cost me the quality of power button is very low easily it can break nice product works as expected as of now no issues good very smooth works on almost every surface paper table cloth etc there bit rattle sound of the plastic which is just above the buttons right left clicks it will not bother most of you am bit obsessive with these kind of things so personally opened the mouse and stuck paper inside the plastic which presses the click button resulting in no rattle sound now mouse only makes sound when you click the buttons click click click battery life of logitech is known to be very good quality good dpi good good accuracy on off switch available smooth good deal at reasonable price good product on which you can use for long time this is good mouse thanks to amazon for providing this product at reasonable price very sharp and correct working mouse,positive

hi used this fin heater in feet room with roof hight at ft it tood hr minutes to raise temperature by degree from to room was closed retirmed it bought black decker fin which is too fast and surpass this bajaj fin bajaj name in itself guarantee of excellence very product heats up the house in no time like boon to elderly people like us this is my review after days of usage firstly feel got used product as the packing was already unpacked inside the box and normally with brand new unused oil heater on first usage you get smell as the oil and fins heat up for first time this did not happen for me anyways just thought to see if all is good and hope it performs the heater has very very slow heating you need to run it at max thermostat and with full load or and even then it will take very long to feel the warmth was able to touch the fins for second even after operating it for more than an hour without cutting off thermostat cut off works but quite below max and then it wont heat up as it gets cut off and on for such type of heater the room should have just one entry and that should not keep opening often if you have doors opening every now and then it will not keep room warm over all for the price it has didn feel like its worth to operate it when it has so slow heating this clearly is one of the best oil heater out there at very good price in offline was getting fin model for to but here at amazon got it at rs this is very silent and heats up the room in to min really worth for the money spent easy to use and can be moved to other rooms without any difficulty the performance is good the product is good but the desired product was not delivered am happy with my decision to buy this heater room gets warm and comfy the radiator works very well even in the cold kullu weather has heat settings and when youve turned it on for while you can turn the heat settings off and the fan will still blow warm air very effective and doesnt give you headache like the rod heaters do has auto cutoff as well,positive
hi viewers so bought this product after watching the endless hauls of amazonfinds as much as was excited for the use of the product it did not prove to be as useful the sealing side does not heat enough for packet to be sealed well the cutter side works fine but mostly the heating side has to be pressed upon so hard that the cell case opens up as it slides with the pressure of the thumb so feel we can totally work without this product in our house its definitely stylish comes with manual cells and hook to hang it but the slipping cell cover fails my convinience with it gud easy to use worth the money when we press to seal lower part get open automatically not heating enamous power to heat and pack the plastic cover quality of the product is not good the hold and press part for heating and sealing is not consistent sometimes it seals sometimes it burns the plastic also the seal comes off of right pressure is applied so it is not reliable too the sealer quality is too good and its sealing well the only thing is you hv to press it hard while sealing takes only few seconds to seal an entire packet good when you are travelling with toddler and carrying lots of snack packets pocket friendly and cute average working,neutral
honest review got these buds in and only buy earbuds because of the music movies series music experience tbh like to hear balanced music like crystal clear sound with balanced bass but yeah if you are bass lover then just think again before buying it battery hypersync bluetooth checked the box and there it written bluetooth but its range is low and that not up to my expectations but it will work for me so yeah if you are just buying it for bluetooth just think again instacharge it actually works very well buds in ear design is good and they fits perfectly also you can do workout exercise running etc but if your own ears are somewhat different like so big then it your problem although it comes with different buds sizes so can try them buds are really so light so yeah personally like them calling experience voice video call these buds don come with anc mode so please don buy them just for anc and incall range is too low which really don expected but it will work for me the sound quality is good no doubt but on personal note such buds dont suit my ear others who used it liked it though very bad quality of product stop working after months please dont waste your money on this earbud good sound good bass all features is nice good in room or silent place some background noise come in open area like road during travel but this prob in all companies like at this price but noise cancellation is not so good good product for this amount rarely facing issue while redmi for my listing music and it has great quality the sound quality is very clear and the range is very good but the bass is not that great,neutral

if you are buying this as secondary cooking appliance or you need portable stove go for this also buy thin induction compatible utensils it takes very long time for thick vessels to heat up before you can start cooking as primary cooking appliance this doesn suit as it very time consuming can be used for keeping things hot or slow boiling milk etc also had to request warranty repair the request was served within days the contact information is present on the warranty card just received it though the product looks new there are few scratches here and there making me unhappy compared its performance with other induction cook top that have with same amount of water at same temperature in the same vessel sadly this cook top is tad slow to boil compared to the old one but think that is okay because the old one which have is rs more than this one product good but its take long time to cooldown good value for money good product easy to operate value for money,neutral
if you are not looking for expensive product this is good choice for you decent size looks decent not great you know what you are paying would recommend this product the product is good delivery made in beautiful way nice packaging good one but should be handled with care it so light and weight for less clothes it can be used handles not stitched well super product good thickness it ok good sturdiness durable and good buy for the money it so so product not so sturdy and durable not also free standing sometime little bit expensive storing capacity is good,positive
if you are using seperate mouse go without cup holder it ll give you some space otherwise it fine for even inch laptop it strong and sturdy but it should be to not everything is perfect the sturdiness the color the finishing the height the weight the only con is that it can be little shaky if you use it on the bed the table is lightweight and less durable but it serves it purpose it good product for its price don expect too much product is good but price rs is little more higher than over all quality of product and also there is no logo of amezon basics it good think the mobile tablet holder is useless material is of good quality and product is worth for money it would be nice to have lock mechanism so that stands doesn tend to close once placed in surfaces like bed the table is very strong will not break easily but its legs are not stable at all if you keep laptop on it and is not supported then the whole table will fall sideways it happened twice to me,neutral

if you want smart phone for just the use of calling and using social media this is very good option for you bought it for my mother who specifically told she just want phone for calling purpose this has only gb of ram so don think of running games like bgmi or asphalt and it also won run very smooth under above normal conditions there is no fingerprint sensor and the camera is trash but the battery is mah and has considerably high battery life there is no fast charging only normal charger is given so in my opinion this is phone for below average user who uses the smart phone just for calling or for scrolling through social media this is worth for price has the latest technical softwares and perform well for minimal usage ofcourse it has configuration less so we should not look better than this battery life more than expected we could buy for this budget range simple and good ok camera ok overall good quality product good unit good good mobile for basic users,positive
ikea sales this product for only it not worth more than that quality is not top notch at first thought orginal product was replaced with first copy but after doing some research got to know it was orginal product costing only directly from ikea seller guess buys from ikea and sale here coz the mrp tag was removed have tried many frothers but this is the best one so far since finally found one where the steel rod does not fall off they should have given one set of battery with the item these batteries are not easily available and my frother is lying useless in my kitchen bad product broken the product suddenly stopped working completely today after about months the speed had deteriorated after one month of use use this product sparingly about once every few days for frothing three four cups of coffee hence there is no reason for this to malfunction there is also no recourse available to me average quality this product is not powerful enough,neutral

immersion heaters have changed very little in terms of features or design over the years or so ve been using them and regardless of which brand name is stamped on them they look like clones of each other it was therefore with some excitement that bought this havells model that had at least three novel features an auto cut off facility temperature control knob and protective plastic cover for that part of the heater users could come into accidental contact with but quite bit of my excitement drained away when the heater arrived couldn use it straightaway because it has cord that barely metre long and it just couldn reach the socket it needs to be plugged into such heavy duty sockets are normally positioned high in most bathrooms so that they are easily accessible to any storage water heaters that may be installed havells should have made allowances for this and added at least another foot and half to the cord length for large scale manufacturer this extra length would have made little difference to the production cost the product anyway is priced couple of hundred rupees more than other heaters the mrp being even higher at rs in my case therefore the heater had to be accessorized before it could be used had to buy stool that would raise the the bucket off the floor and thus compensate for the shortness of the cord and no it can be any stool lying around in your home it has to be stool of certain height about inches for me any taller and the bucket can be accommodated under the tap any shorter and you begin cursing havells again for their miserliness with the cord the stool took two days to arrive and inaugurated the heater full four days after it was delivered thank god my old immersion heater was still usable in spite of its heavily calcified condition there is yet another problem with this heater though it helpfully allows you to choose between three temperature settings you don know what value each setting corresponds to what does high temperature mean degrees celsius seventy found out the hard way when set the temperature high and the heater wouldn switch itself off for minutes which is five minutes longer than the time my old heater takes to heat up some litres of water and by then the water had turned scaldingly hot tried the medium setting the next day and again had the nasty experience of having to deal with extra hot water perhaps the right setting is low then not sure neither the product literature that came with the heater nor the havells website has any information that will help you choose the right setting and stop you burning yourself so both the innovative features of this heater that made me buy it the variable heat setting and the auto cut off ultimately turned out to be quite useless still have to depend on my instinct and on my experience with my old featureless heater and manually turn the heater off when think it done its job have question for other users of this product or for the manufacturer can the temperature be set to in between values something between low and medium for instance the way the controlling knob is marked with several lines between the presets suggests this is possible or maybe that yet another useless feature of this fancy heater more trial and error but should such basic piece of equipment be so difficult to use update after week use of this heater like to add word of caution for the benefit of other buyers and users since the heater has its own indicator light which switches off at the set temperature you may forget to switch the socket switch off particularly if the switch is away from the socket as in some contemporary bathrooms that have all switches bunched together at the bathroom door if you forget to switch the socket off and in the meantime have removed the heater from the bucket it will begin to heat up again once the temperature has fallen below the set value this dry heating will damage both the heater and wall if you ve hung the heater up but more significantly it will also be extremely hazardous if your body is wet and there no one around to switch the socket off for you this happened to me twice call me dumb if you want to but please be careful the product is good and does its work didn find any use of the thermostat feature as though it turns off automatically the low temper in itself is very hot it take just to mins to get the water be bath ready further the product says that ilthe rod should not touch the bucket but the product handle is made in such way that it touches but that causes no trouble it not shock proof so don check temperature of water with it turned on product received with some scratches don know how inside package product gets scratches other than that all is okay product is good and it shock proof for extra safety but no recommended to touch water value for money product is good satisfactory one minor issue the cord is little too hard its working as expected no issues found till now but have observed the red light is not coming fully could see only partial red light is visible overall best product nice this product is very good and easy to use but its plug is of amps which should have been of amps,positive

installed it myself in my kitchen and it is very useful good heating of water good but water become so hot can put your hand in it if it mixes the cold or running water with the hot water it will be good or water temperature can be adjusted it will be great the product is very good easy to install and easy to use the water spray jet is also good with movebale outlet water comes out either hot degree centigrade or cold same like your water tank temperature thought will getting mixed water as there is no provision of controlling the temperature always the water is more hot that you even cannot put your hand and if you bring the knob towards cold it immediately cools down so it is either hot or cold not both even if you slightly move the knob towards the hot side within sec the temperature rises to degree centigrade from degree centigrade was expecting reostat to control the temperature not able to use for the required purpose for kitchen pls do not purchase this items water does not get hot at all you reduce or increase water pressure it biggest weakness that there is no option to increase the temperature or last one its price totally worth less wonderful product in this segment and value added product for home during winter the water gets extremely hot when given in hot mode and quickly gets cold when cold water option is switched ideal should be like geyser it should have the option for both hot and cold water running parallelly so that nice warm water flows and things get done one cannot wash dishes with hand when water is very hot or very cold,positive

it been days since using the device extensively bought it on the last freedom sale for rs including instant discount coupon first let me be clear bought fe with snapdragon not fe with exynos and am user who uses phone most of the time this review may be long but it worth to read it if you re buying this product let me divide between the pros and cons first would like like to start with pros of the device pros display samsung has been already popular for it amoled displays but saw some of the reviewers wrote about some display issues here they might have got some defective piece have no issues with my display it been long time saw great display like this with hz it is super smooth also it is very bright on outdoors and can decrease it to very low while using at low light conditions ps no tint issues the in display finger print scanner is very fast and didn faced any issues with it stereo speakers as an extensive multimedia user this is one of the most favorable feature for me believe me you can find any other device with such great sound quality in this price segment it almost like flagship devices both the speakers are adequately loud battery as person who shifting from normal hz device phone was very worried about the battery life of this device at hz but it surprised me very well initially thought would need to switch to hz for better battery life for daily usage but didn even thought this device would give this much great battery life at hz at hz am getting around hours of minimum sot screen on time the maximum sot got at hz is hours minutes didn checked battery life at hz because didn use it at hz even single day the battery life is excellent rear cameras am not very good photographer or something am just an ordinary person who use camera occasionally was very excited to use the telephoto lens which only can be found on flagship devices and it performs very well added some camera samples above pic ultrawide pic telephoto pic may not be clear as it was when taken due to compression of the image while uploading both the three cameras primary ultrawide telephoto performs very well if you re camera guy you should definitely check this out performance ram management not gamer use my device for daily usage of social media ott platforms calls messages etc but use it extremely didn faced any kind of heating issues with the device until now also ram management of the device is excellent am person who uses appsbackground at single time and didn have any issues of closing down the apps one ui was stock android guy but one ui actually surprised me it is very well optimised and very user friendly for single hand usage initial days found it little hard to use the stock menu of one ui but now got used to it ps didn found any kind of ads on my device as didn sign up or used any samsung apps build quality even though its back is made up of plastic the overall build quality is super premium the aluminium frame gives us feel like using flagship device future proof the device has bands ip rating wireless charging which are very hard to find on any device in this price bracket ip wireless charging are mostly only found on flagship devices its good to see samsung brings it at lower price this is the best future proof device as of now so these are the major pros noticed as of now now let move to the cons cons no hdr support on netflix as an extensive multimedia user found it very frustrating even mid range devices offering hdr support on netflix samsungs flagship killer doesn have hdr support it will not be fixed via ota update no gb variant this is actually not problem for most of the people but as power user who uses dual sim found it little difficult but if you re single sim user luckily it have hybrid solution so you can use sim card expandable memory card gorilla glass other competitors are providing atleast gg in this price range but fe has just gg which also not sure as it is not mentioned officially anywhere but at the end of the day glass is glass it will broke no headphone jack it is not any kind of unusual thing most of the phones above segment doesn have headphone jack so we have to buy mm to type adapter type earphones or bluetooth solutions note only buy original samsung type adapter else it may not support no charger it is not actually con for me as prefer low watt charger which is good for battery health and beneficial for long term usage but it may be con for you although the device supports charging only charger is provided inside the box they should have given inside the box didn have any issues with charger but it would be great if they bundle it with as competitors are way ahead in terms of charging speed for the reference of charging speed both will full charge the device almost at the same time but using you can get about within minutes where as with charger full charge time usually takes is hour and minutes front camera am not selfie guy but if you re person who looking for selfie device just don buy it it not like the front camera quality is really bad or anything but it not even near to the rear camera quality and you can find better selfie smartphones in this price range conclusion if you re person who wants device for normal day to day usage with good battery life great rear cameras great performance better software support better build quality and use it for more than years the cons mentioned above doesn bother you just buy it am sure you won be disappointed it been about days since got this phone got it for on prime day sale for the price it good pros camera coming from poco the camera quality on this is amazing according to the price it gives you good colours contrast focus and everything that you want it has ois which is very apparent while recording at the stability is worse but set it to and the videos will be amazingly stable and the main advantage of ois other than stable video is great night mode shots hold the phone stable for while and along with ois you will get great photos with accurate colors and nice exposure attached samples display absolutely best samsung displays are the best hz fhd flows smoothly colors and calibration is top notch brightness is good but felt it little insufficient under direct sunlight it visible but could be better one ui the main reason for upgrading to this phone was software one ui is the absolute best android skin right now it has way too many customisations in it and let you personalise your phone to very high degree like there feature to read out the name of the person who calling if your wearing headphones it took me days to fully go through all the settings and change them to my needs also knoxx security is special mention knoxx security is software and hardware feature in samsung phones which protects your phone from all kinds of attacks and keeps your data safe even if it gets stolen you can remotely delete all your data secure folder allows you to store data in separate storage and many more such good features while being very feature rich and storage heavy skin it still feels very very smooth and fast to use unlike miui or other skins it doesn stutter much and bugs are less there are many other small pros like good stereo speakers nice premium build quality good data and wifi speeds other such features that you won notice but definitely make difference in your experience cons software know said it pro but say this in the aspect of updates this phone was launched in march in india and samsung promises year android version updates and additional year of security updates but there lot of confusion regarding if or not this phone will receive android it will receive for sure there lot of debate on what they will do with because of global version launch date being earlier and yada yada basically the phones life maybe to years if they give but to if not researched on the internet few people say that it will receive while was few say it not it hard to say who correct so assume it not getting if you are going for it battery the battery on this phone is mah and it good enough for days use but that because use it lightly not much online streaming no gaming light social media and other usual stuff if you use it even tad bit more heavily you will run out within day if you re going outside for the better part of day like day trip to somewhere nearby it better keep power bank handy in terms of screen on time numbers once got hours of sot on light usage hr you tube and hr streaming was at home and used wifi all the time got hrs sot when went outside for day trip took many photos and videos and the phone shutdown before could reach home on mixed use day you can get to hours of sot final verdict the life of the phone in terms of software support is not great but you will get on time updates and almost no bugs in the software so if you want to buy it you can and exchange it after maybe years for other models but if you planning on using it for longer than years better avoid it in the upcoming diwali and dussera sales the price might further drop to even am just speculating but keep in mind your requirements and go accordingly as always amazing delivery by amazon,positive
it been just week so yet to know the performance overall but till date it working fine good good quality battery capacity is very poor of power product is fine but was disappointed by seeing made in china lable on png version also seller sent lpg model first instead of png so check your model once received product is working fine seems to be working fine till now but very very poor service by bajaj serviceman he came and just hanged the geyser on wall and said his work was limited to that only we had to call another technician on our own to complete the installation and do the plumbing work even pipes cells did not come with the geyser and were sold by bajaj serviceman separately marks to bajaj for service,neutral
it been only days and used it to transfer gb for now so have not used it enough would update this after some days my relative bought seagate onetouch its best competitor so would compare it with it speed multiple photos gb got mbps max but consistent single file gb got mbps max and it was more or less consistent the onetouch reached mbps for multiple big files didnt check it further build it is very sleek and lightweight for sure but it does not feel very premium it is plastic all around you can definitely feel the vibration of the platters while file transfer the onetouch was very premium feeling metal and plastic body and could feel its vibrations but it was much less than passport the passport is slimmer and shorter than onetouch maybe thats why software my experience has not been much good could not register my product for some days the screen got white and did not show anything there is no free backup software you are asked to backup on gdrive dropbox or onedrive no recovey tool included think it is paid service not sure about the last one cant say about the software experience on onetouch didnt see it but it includes months adobe cc if you are into this reliability now the big part this is the only reason bought this one otherwise would no doubt go for the onetouch seagate drives tend to fail twice as much as wd drives so could not take risk many claim seagate has now learnt from their mistake and is falling behind by staying in the top spot cant say about the first sentence but quite sure about the second misc came with no bubble wrap only plastic tray which was maybe well enough cable could be bit better onetouch one had grip for pulling it out and seemed better has fine texture on body so no fingerprint onetouch and this one both are same price you can go for anyone of these sorry for the long review but wanted to tell the buyers the complete story would update my review later amzon realy amzing service if not discount but amzon not provide fake so like to buy amzon product tb wd hard drive amazing am extremely satisfied with my purchase the hdd is compact and lightweight making it easy to carry around with me it is also very easy to use all had to do was plug it in and it was ready to go the tb of storage space is more than enough for my needs and it is great way to store and back up all of my important data the hdd is also very fast which makes transferring files breeze overall am extremely happy with my purchase of this tb external hdd it is reliable and convenient to store and back up my data and would highly recommend it to anyone in need of additional storage space good quality happy with this product very nice do not forget to buy its case separately product is good it heats up quickly,positive
it china product to be clear look and feel is good base of the device is little wider so if you have pin socket points consecutively then ysing the next socket could be difficult the wi fi signal strength is good as extender but it reduces internet speed for example my internet speed is mbps which get if directly connected to my primary router network but if connected through extender it downgrades to mbps overall okay to use would have been happy to see made in india device as the price is also not very low but unfortunately india is not manufacturing any it seems band is an ancient technology this device will supply only ghz that means ghz will not be available in your room where you choose to use this it was difficult to use and install at first after that its been working perfectly with great signal strength it is good product valued for money but think it should be sometimes give low speed wish could have ordered dual band but so far it giving satisfactory service working fine product is ok but its only for ghz mistakenly got it,positive

it cost should be under rs buy it color is as per the photo but takes longer to charge also doesnt charge on all sockets seems to work better when plugged in directly in the laptop length of the cable is long so that you can happily use it for long distance as week and quality is really good meter ink charging wire for phone long and strong one for use have been using this lighting cable for almost month now and the cable turned out exactly as it was shown took the rose gold one that matches my phones color although the metal ends of the cable was rose gold but the whole cable was pink which didnt like went for the long cable so that can use it conveniently even if it is charging though its kinda bulky yet serves its purpose charging speed is fast and efficient just like the original cable had also quite durable and sturdy my apples original lighting cable had some problem while charging so purchased this one after watching many you tube videos and reviews it was indeed good purchase its long and good its superb product in terms of sturdiness looks and charging speed,positive
it does it job perfectly only issue is temp control is not perfect need to keep checking the browness of sandwich untill it gets upto ur choise product is good but the control knob is to be be modified cause after the cooking process completes the control knob should be return back to initial starting place if not that process timer should be given basically so think well what happens whether didn had atleast one option not indicator option it is nice product easy to use the grilling function is also wonderful but the exterior metallic finish picks up finger marks and other spots which tend to become permanent cleaning them is almost impossible very good product this is pretty powerful sandwich maker for home use the product looks good has sturdy build and heats up quick the sandwiches are made pretty quickly without burning rs review unboxing recommend work as expected its easy tp use,positive
it does the job really well no complaints regarding the charging power at price of rs it is worth every buck although this cable is bit shorter than the original one but the original one plus cable is around rs so there is huge price difference and it does the same job as the original one useful for type charging but not suitable with all adapters or usb points serves the purpose sturdily built does its job well charged my samsung galaxy quicker than the original cable hope it stays the same going ahead liked the charging speed disliked the length on pads this is awesome but its is not foot long so this the only point to think otherwise it is the best cable good everything is good including connectivity and stuff nice product im using this for my car this product is nice and worth the amount recommend it to anyone who are looking for this kind of cable,positive

it has been only month since have bought this item so can comment on its durability but currently it is working perfectly sound quality is good fitting in ear is perfect which has been constantly an issue with other earphones have used till now have doubt on its durability because its wires are kind of handle with care if it is durable then it will be among one of the best earphones have used till now unable to hear after months good budget earphones for taking call and listening to music watching videos once in while be careful with the wire though as it can get tangled easily and is not that strong best buying in these range the hi is budget friendly in ear earphone and it really comes at great price but the next version of these si has more value for money factors like hi has angled mm jack whereas si has the normal one and am not supposed to say this but trust me si has the best best best and superior sound quality if compared to hi though it doesn have great durability but if your previous earphones were si and you are switching on these then one can definitely notice the difference between the si and hi although you can adapt the sound of hi in nearly about week if you are switching from si to be honest the si is literally best in all circumstances such like gaming listening to music and professional editing the vocals mids highs lows are perfectly balanced in si but not hi in hi mostly when listening to sing the bass was not up to mark and the vocals were so loud that the bass was literally fading main point is that whenever we hit the full volume both of them never distorted any single beat hat off to harman good earphones short time usage its good with very clear voice and average bass clarity am not giving stars because certain bass can be improved bit more overall its good one was looking for budget earphones with voice clarity jblc hi does the work except for bass quality there nothing else to complain about,neutral
it has been week since we bought the led tv its definitely value for money buy good picture and sound quality loaded with abundant apps and features the flip side is the installation time as has been mentioned by others in earlier posts it took several calls to the toshiba customer service very laidback and definitely not pro active final escalation to the service head worked and by then it was days since the product arrived and was lying still product wise no complaint delivery wise no complaint this product am recived days but not insatlation services is very poor good quality of picture and sound sound achi hai toshiba regza engine is good this product now owned by hi sense tv company of china which number rank tv company through out the world in your tight budget it is good ok at this price range think you will never find as good as this the quality best smart tv worth able price for the product but installation is poor,positive

it is big to travelling purpose other wise it is good if you travelling out side with your baby then it will best option for you to take it and use it for hot water and khechadi also you can make itili on this one minor concern is this product is sensitive to water it means if want to cook food without water then it will torn off automatically for example if want cook some fried thing then should use oil first then at that moment it will not work because you used oil so you cannot fry anything on it only you can do using water everything that can be done by using that be done using it so keep this thing on your mind while purchasing this item apart form this everything works great it is good for small family and easy to clean pl provide at least meier cord for immediate use and mak eplace for movement cord size is very small think it good product had to return it because off size it very small and doubt it useful for rice cooking it good for steaming and boiling not wasy to use and quality of moulds etc is really bad complicated process of how much water to fill no clear instructions on cooking,neutral

it is good and fragile simply affixed on screen there was little difficulty faces as guide frame supplied is not according to glass but some how fixed it successfully and thanks to seller for supply pair of screen guard packaging was also good it really of good quality have read problems like the apple pencil doesn work after applying this protector but honestly didn feel any lag rated because one of the protectors created bubble at specific area and didn get out even after trying so hard and following all the instructions properly and had to use another one which got applied properly without creating any bubbles ended up wasting one tempered glass because of air bubbles that wouldnt go away skipped wiping with micro fibre cloth which may have led to the problem however the other glass worked fine had to take off my pad cover to enable the application the previous one wouldnt align with the cover in place adhesion of the first one gave up as soon as tried to lift and reapply again might be attributable to the fact that didnt get rid of the dust particles like should have the one that successfully applied works just fine good product decent alignment great product theres no such anti glare thing also not really good for using apple pencil mean the surface is not paper like thats why one more thing it gets fingerprints really fast application is very easy but take care there is no dust on the ipad because if bubbles formed you cannot correct it good,positive

it is very beautiful looking and appears imported good for placing at one spot on office table etc and not to be moved it is very light so easily tumbles down wire cord is very short heating is good it is not strong and sturdy but made of plastic outerbody which will break if it falls down more than week im using this product pros compact easy to use portable good built quality cons light weight no manual control over saftey switch takes time to heat small room small cable length conclusion if you are looking for gud luking compact heater you can buy it if you are expecting high skip it like the product design quality using in my room it takes to min to reduce the room temperature will recommend this product the only positive about this device is its price otherwise all it has is negative the heater is very light weight but that negative coz it too light to trust it to work safely device working at such high temperature require some weight to have stability so that weay feel confident that it won topple the manufacture has given safe switch at the bottom of the device but the device remains at high temp for sometime even after being off the material body material feels very cheap and doesn give confidence that it would last long though the ptc heating element may last long there is nothing to prevent entry of dust and fiber into the heater that may lead to fire in the long run if fibres accumuulate inside also without any dust filter the heating plates will get blocked very very soon the switch on the backside to switch off and on also appears to be of the cheapest quality there is not temperature control in this heater so once you start it it will run continuously so can be used as overnight heater in your bedroom so would suggest it would be better to go for slightly costly heaters which have temp control and better quality as abious amazon delivery service is awesome received this product in days build built qiality is amazing dint expect this metal frame and smooth plastic finish light weight to carry and portable the best part liked about it it never took time to heat just switch it on and it started blowing heat and it easily heats the room withing minutes but bare oin mind it takes power all can say is its the best product in this price you will not regret buying it the heater is effective easy to use and very compact work is good like it very much av very low quality heater without any temperature control it burned my switchboard it keeps drawing current without any control great product for the price considering it has ceramic element,neutral

it is very easy to use and egg get boiled within min it is portable and easy to carry and cook eggs in one time even design and quality of the product is nice amazing product in less money thanks amazon good to use egg boiled properly the only thing wrong colored product is delivered but thats ok will manage amazing product with automatic off facility easy to use and time efficient must try it good product just improve quality and working is very good it works really good it been month now using this boiler and it works fine till date things to make note of when you boil keeping all eggs at time there re chances of slight breaking of or eggs which in my case but works fine if you try with or or lesser no the wire is short so you ll need to have plug point nearer to the base or use stool the boiled eggs are slight softer whites than the usual eggs that are boiled on stove but you ll get accoustemed to it can be used only to boil eggs and frying directly is not working measuring cup is provided and can be used to measure water for soft medium or hard boiling of eggs very convenient to boil the eggs good for everyday use only problem is the wire is very very short just ft it makes bit tricky to use as you need to put something below so that the plug could reach the socket atleast they should have provided mtr length wire cleaning is easy but as it has air openings at bottom you need to carefully wash it,positive

it is very good product quality is decent but the only problem facing is that is incompatible with with my tablet and my mobile phone if it was compatible it would be great and sometimes it just keep disconnecting from the device don know if it my device or its the product anyways it good product to have all times connecting pin was bit tight to insert to my macbook getting it for from this brand is what made me order this go for it if you work only with usb devices you can access devices at time but not sure about the speed while switchinf the windows for now its quite okay to browse the files when one pen drive is connected usb port is somewhat not easy to plug when connected to laptop its hard to remove it smoothly served the purpose and delivered as marketed bought it for overall build sturdy and premium no doubt functionality usb port side one usb front my ssd gave ish mb read write seq on the port less for random read write same ssd gave ish max mb read write seq on the port even tho for me it is ok they could ve provided us with more high speed ports cord is too short and price too high bought this to use for connecting mouse and keyboard to my mac book and have been using this for the last months before buying this looked at multiple products at various price ranges finally chose this product as this offers the brand assurance and is way cheaper compared to similar items from other reliable brands so far working really well nice way to use usb devices on macbook air in cheap price,positive
it is working as expected so far no complaints godod the product is definitely worth the price and keeps the laptop super cool am not gamer and this review is not for gaming pc its very convenient for my office work the cooling pad has an additional usb and it helps in case an additional usb port is required when using the cooling pad not in mostly use good product but fan speed is little slow tried it on my gaming and office laptop there was difference in temperatures on gaming laptop office laptop hp core th gen did feel slightly cool to touch with the cooling pad but its ergonomics aren great but its value for money the two fans offer very little airflow and audible noise in winters body is sturdy enough but the laptop slips from the top grill and when you use the non slip clips on the front they come in the way of your hands while working on the laptop your hand essentially rests on those clips and it hurts design needs improvement and fans should have higher airflow accordingly customer wouldn mind slightly higher price it is decent product and economic in this price range fan speed is decent for better speed give power from your charger not recommended for high end performance laptops good product that keeps that decreases the laptop heat my dell vostro with th gen would hover at around during regular use such as browsing movies youtube ps emulation etc but with this cooler the temps came down to during heavy gaming tested with fallout new vegas cpu gpu the laptop heated up as if there was no cooling pad but the laptop surface felt cooler please note that live in hill station and the climate is generally cool so your experience may be different have not tested this with gaming laptop,positive

it little small for big hands but best available in the market good product but too smaller than the regular one hello everyone bought this mouse in april so after months of use writing this review battery the most important one it came with single aa sized battery clock battery that worked from st april th december which is more than months even though my usage was heavy hours average per day in corporate job day of hours look amazing with beautiful curves though battery closing pane could have been better usb transmitter it normal and can be carried inside the battery cavity switch on off switch is not handy you need long nail to switch it on off but is strong enough to resist hard stroke when you force it to off with your nailless fingers precision and laser precision is just what most mouses have which is accurate and the laser is invisible no annoying light in the bottom buttons buttons produce slight noise on click and after long usage the left button is shaking slightly overall ratings the main reason for you to buy this its battery efficiency it will cost you only inr for months its very small and it trouble for my hand which is considerably smaller than other people it do fit nicely in year old nephew but now mine but no complains works great from far distance so its good there its should be sold for only its slighly over priced nice mouse easy to hold working very smooth and fast response time is very good good durable product its great mouse under this price for normal office use it would have been much better if it had silent clicks working well so far,positive

it original price is not worth any praise so try to purchase on some card offers or other free bundles the screen is not full hd but still offers good brightness and color accuracy speaker also sounds good enough front camera is not for selfies only for video calls but back camera produces satisfactory clicks for entry level battery backup is one of the best features of this device samsung softwares are all well optimised and my only complaint in this department is the pre installed bloatwares ui feels smooth enough and the mediatek processor coupled with gb ram is well suited for daily normal usage games are not recommended biggest disadvantage of this device is it in box charger which is only watts that takes about hours for decent charge heating issues during use with in minutes uses touch screen issues some times it too great and some time have to touch several times even on samsung key pad while typing we all family are using samsung mobiles but this time worried of issues if have to face same issues have to change mobile and transfer data it very irritating work wish to if any one of samsung is reading this review please reply me through amazon bought for mom as she just want to use for calls she is not selfie or video person didnt want to go for realme xiaomi redmi poco products because of their support this already comes with android and two year updates are assured the display is really good not full hd screen though call quality is good wanted smaller size but unfortunately the price doesnt fall under for them if you are buying for lots of photos videos this is not the phone for you if you want to use for call do basic things like whatsapp and other things this would be good phone for you this phone was bought for first time smartphone user it was good fit for the said user thank you samsung and amazon normal phone with very average screen quality battery backup also not very good but yes its worth it thumbs up under this budget samsung exlent mobile battery and screen best quality rejonabule price midle class best of mobile better price with discount performing well an affordable mobile from premium company,positive
it quality is really good and it can carry to laptops easily no problem to take must be taken the quality is great the stitching is also strong the stitching is very ordinary and it looks bad on the inner side decent purchase the product does not have zip and preferred to use black side the red side gets fluffy measures are to inch your laptop should be smaller then this size so that it fits and easy to remove fit perfectly for laptop material is good not best but within this price it is really good bit expensive could have been under rupees justified works well prevents from dust undoubtedly one should go for it product looks good big size want small size,positive

it very easy to use and easy to clean it does it job as described only drawback is that the motor unit heats up very quickly even with very little use have only used this product twice so far so can speak for its durability also the price has been dropping steadily on this product wondering why only time will tell how long this product will last awesome built quality with perfect packaging blender is working good working good till now easy to use to clean all make lot of sauces purees and dressings use my blender almost every day but the construction of the blender is such that the food often falls below the blades and am constantly readjusting the ingredients to get the ingredients blended it can take considerable amount of time and lot of patience but this immersion blender can puree fruits and vegetables in less than minutes and do it evenly and consistently it is easy to use and lightweight cleaning consists of removing the shaft with the blades and handwashing it you can wipe off the handle with damp cloth and stick both in drawer my standard blender requires thorough washing of the various parts pitcher blades screw on attachment and lid so am moving the standard blender from the counter to storage if need it have it highly recommend this powerful blender go for it,positive

it very useful in winter when it gets cold and curd does not form properly it maintains fixed temperature enabling fermentation process gave one star less because it does not have any handles so holding the apparatus can be tricky as it has this smooth surface so it might slip off from hands you have to be very careful while holding and handling this curd maker if they give side handles and auto cut off feature then it would be best package arrived in good condition now need to contact company for warranty good product to settle hassle free yogurt only thing is it should automatically cut of power once yogurt is ready else yogurt tastes amazing got the product looks good checking now am writing this review after using the product for three weeks have chosen this as agaro brand seems to be more trustworthy and has years warranty year months extra after registering good things it works as expected for my taste and local weather conditions it takes nearly hours this will vary based on individual taste and local weather conditions very light weight cleaning is easy and there is no problem even if there is bit of spill not so good things quantity is not liters it is few ml more than liter plastic covers are delicate and there is chance of them getting damaged while cleaning in my opinion manufacturer should have provided optional spare set of covers considering the cost build quality is sufficient as it is made in china length of the wire is cms and usually requires an extension good product good product it just amazing this sentence is enough to comment for this unique thing never ever had ever imagined to make yogurt in quick time and even in winter without any compromise in taste,positive
it was easy to assemble the manual explains the procedure of assembly for both with and without resting pad and the height can be adjusted accordingly just felt it is not sturdy enough the product packaging was good and clean while assembling could see there are minute scratches other than that it looks good and sturdy good one using for office work and my wife using for vegetable cutting purpose also have been more sturdy and the fittings attached to the table top are easily felt which feels cheap pro are good for wfh and if you have budget constraint angles and height adjustment is best you can easily adjust the height to any chair you are using good,positive
it was good ok with the price it depends on the dough you prepare with little practice we can make pluffy rotis only thing is we cannot touch the steel part of the roti maker while preparing rotis the steel part gets heated up so we have to carefully deal with it without touching the steel part other concern is it is inches only for making alu parathas like that if the size was bigger than it like inches like that then it was more easy to make stuffed parathas it worth to have roti maker with you cooks fast rotis and all depends on practice cooked methi parathes too and we re good found parathes was much good in roti maker am lazy it me and my husband here for two persons rotis making found its much easy it should have in each kitchen if you have atta maker also than making rotis are not much hurdle for roti maker dough must be soft and atta maker makes soft dough too so must have both than your rotis will be good like the product for one person it was hard to make dough pressing and cooking now by this chapati maker everything become easy extremely good value formoney clear instructions and easy to use good for making parathas more than rotis it an excellent product kids and males can also easily use it really the best value for money don even think for any other brands just go for for libra chapati maker truly gathering guests is no more tension,positive

it worked well for some days later it is not working want it to replace nice superb product with white lights at both ends when charging colour and quality feels very premium build quality nice product highly recommended good quality and looks beautiful will surely recommend after using it for weeks use samsung few months back my usb cable was torn so wasn able to fast charge it took decade to charge from samsung original cable was too pricey and too flimsy so was searching for something durable while browsing through the product page was skeptical to place an order as the company claimed too many features in such low price keeping the negative thoughts aside ordered it anyhow the product was delivered well in advance which made me happy unboxed and plugged in the cable to my surprise the cable delivered everything that the company claimed the ends have aluminum casing which makes it durable and away from regular wear and tear it has led indicator on both ends which turns on when the charger is plugged to the phone also the box that it comes with has secret code that you need to scratch to reveal which helps to check its authenticity it easily fast charges my phone in an hour overall very happy with the product highly recommend this cable to anyone who needs fast charging type to cable will update this review if any change is observed,positive

it works as expected but the shape of the handle is not very comfortable it is not feeling very handy to hold the device and press the button at the same time sometimes the battery door opens while using it its easy to use but creates mess when try to make coffee froth doesnt form froth also only runs under liquid the frother stops spinning in even slightly dense liquid product is not working smoothly after very hard press the button then it works easy to use and nice product but cream stucks in it sometimes can finally make frothy dalgona coffee without losing my arm lol worth it coffee came out really well and so easy to use good,neutral
it works great for my laptop this is good accessory to connect sata drives to computer via usb interface the advantage is that there is no need to stop computer attach drive to sata then restart format etc this is faster to install without turning off the computer the con is that the data transfer speed is less also this cannot be used to boot from so its just an accessory to transfer data to and from computer in easy way but one cannot boot into this like one can using usb drive it is very handy speed is awesome working flawlessly but the build quality is very delicate they should improve the build quality but the main job can be done without any problem and getting upto mbps speed the product is good for the use not cheap but its ok price also usb so its fast and the quality of the material is not that bad its plastic but good plastic amazon sent replacement as the first delivered cable stopped functioning in one hour the product works it seems usb compliant but it is very flimsy for product that could be used multiple times and will need to be connected and detached from inch hdd or ssd the plastic housing for the sata port can be squished and it even bends and moves little the cable is foot long but is thin and needs to be thicker have another usb to sata port adapter but it is pretty sturdy if you are going to keep the sata part connected always then this product could be ok but not recommended for professionals who rely on such cable to connect multiple drives in day its working fine with old seagate hard disk okay product online price could be maximum strictly in my opinion,neutral
it works more than expected little bit lose but other than that it works well till date it is really long and that is so much useful quality is good love it no issues so far bought for around rupees cable is little bit lengthier they have mentioned the length of the cable too so cant complain it overall the product is far far better best and worth for the penny build quality is great looks good as well my last amazonbasics cable lasted around years so am expecting the similar from this one not supporting for car play and this product want to cancel but amazon dont have option to cancel sturdy and durable using since one month no issues reported nice product by amazon basics,positive
item is good but bottom lid should have provided along with the item once after blending juice or protein shakes we can use the top bottle directly as sipper but without bottom lid we cant close the juice bottle and the liquid will be spoiled if not drank within mins request seller to provide bottom lid to close the bottle even low cost blenders in market are providing else the product is ok good and compact good for travelers to prepare the juice blends dry fruits with for me it very helpful as carry it while travel extremely handy very good for smoothies price on the higher side though good for travelling with babies or kids it good although it did give some start issue it just that fruit veggies pieces should be small bought with too much expectations and found out ml to be too low for blending shake with one full apple gm oats milks and gm nuts it struggles to start and we need to turn it upside down to give the blade some momentum and then it starts blending for someone who is going to carry it is your best bet but for stationary heavy blending buy something else with direct power source,positive
item is good no issues it supports mobile which have great charging inbuilt feature charging is good but cable quality not good good if your smartphone doesn support more than fast charging then this will cover it for you would suggest getting different cable if you want something with more length but the standard cable it comes with is pretty solid no cheap feeling whatsoever pretty good charger for any mobile device provided that the device supports fast charging and usb type port ofcourse it is would like to suggest this to all of them who are subjected to irreparable in box charger especially redmi note pro users very good product bought this to charge my mi mobile even though the mi has lower amps and voltage rating than this charger upon research found that mobile communicates with the charger and only requests the required amps and voltage from it and this has proven to be right as my mobile is perfectly charging with this charger you wont find this good of charger and cable combo for this price,positive

its easy to use and amazing product by amazon thank you waffles came out nice crisp the product did great job rather than spending high bucks on branded ones like borosil or prestige would recommend this waffle machine it value for money for single waffle maker this is best the product is worth buying if you like making waffles in the breakfast or give new texture to the sandwiches you make it become daily part of our kitchen it cute easy to use and clean can make range of waffles sweet or savoury like to cook each waffle twice till it more crispy absolutely go for it makes great gift too convenient not giving it stars as there was no measuring cup as promised otherwise successfully made very cute yummy waffle been on my bucket list for long time after seeing shivesh video kinda promotion actually decided to buy for my daughter on her day very easy to use to clean as well but takes time to bake but maybe that how it is with any waffle maker don know but for beginners it good buy very good however size is small,positive
its easy to use and is okay guess doesnt clean the lint completely but enough to not be spotted from the viewers point of view its good nice easy to use product its very bad and within use its not working if you have found this product then please do not go away without getting it its wonderful product you have to use it to know how great it is if could give stars sure would have everything is good except the lid which collects fibres from clothes does fit tightly overall good product one time investment better than roller lint removers product is working as expected and handling is also easy good to have product as some clothes develop lint and looks old very easy after using this product cloth is looking like new had battery operated lint remover earlier but this is power plugged hence power is optimum at all times good fan size and great blade cutting extra blade also in the kit only used twice so durability cant be reviewed handling etc is fine totally worth it,positive
its good and easy to use the product appears cheap but works alright as you might know from the product description there are speed settings decent product for this price range its very nice poweful but needs proper care cleanup after every use also should keep changing batteries when see the power low been using it for years now however piece lasts for about year if taken proper care the compartment to insert cells should have been little bigger it might break while trying to squeeze the cells in this useful product very easy to use and clean looks very light but is of good quality froths milk efficiently must buy if you like frothy coffee or milk waste product dont buy this by its brand name or by its price very delicate product this is certainly great product saves time as getting froth in conventional way you need to be very patient nowadays everyone needs something quick this served my purpose bought extra that am planning to gift thank you,neutral

its good product in this price would hardly get any worst thing about the product as far am using this its totally fine battery life is good case is good looks is good and the sound is great this range this product is good if you are thinking about other companies than thats also fine first compare than buy you will enjoy the music for sure it loud with decent bass but if you are picking this up for calls it ok when you are in silent sapce it definitely not good option if you have to use them for calls during ride or in noisy public places not good for callig good for music you get what you pay for does the job the button is very sensetive so even when you when to press them to go back right into your ears something or the other gets happens may be it too early for me to get use to it over all alright product for the price bluetooth connectivity good too small need to be careful if ur moving around well only time will answer if it worth the price does not fit in ear always falls rest is ok,neutral
its good product used for inch tv had to get it installed by tv mechanic gud for inch above tv best awesome nice and sturdy the quality of the product is outstanding the stand is not suitable for inch and above arrived in good condition quality of mount is excellent heavy and sturdy it has paper manual with clear steps and tools required for installation installation was easy and quick happy with this purchase inch to can handle this,positive
its good purchase for long term personally like it because it came with install kits and costed me around and trust me its very easy to install and its protected the device for fall of bed to ground overall nice product it very nice saw video on you tube and got to know that the best way to apply this is as soon as you remove the paper which comes along the phone hence you can easily avoid dust particles it worked well with me happy but scratch resistance capabilities have to be checked yet but it also bit pricy for glass need to wait and check its life span and protection quality after putting lots of screen protectors found this was the easiest no need to think about alignment as the alignment tray makes it breeze found two big air bubbles after installation but those were removed very easily with the squeege tool overall the process took hardly mins just clean the screen properly before installing to avoid any dust mark below screen protector good and easy to install its easy to install quality is great doesnt cause issues with camera and is better than the original screen itself in terms of touch feel oleophobic coating on it is really good ive been using it since over months now and its not faded at all its bit expensive but it keeps phones screen looking new and shiny and it is much much better than the cheap ones in doing so its night and day difference fit and finish is really good too applying it is super easy otherwise dont see it protecting the phone screen from cracking or scratching more than the cheaper or the more expensive ones recommend getting this over others primarily because itll keep your expensive phone looking new the product is good easy to install and comes with wonderful package but it too costly rs if happen to get this for discount or deal then go for it this screen protector is super quick and easy to install all the tools and institutions provided makes it breeze,positive

its no brainer to get this just that the edges dont fix in properly there is always air bubble kind of thing on the edge easy to apply and no bubbles for rs they send units which is amazing too satisfied with the purchase overall good and easy to apply doesnt cover percent of screen small gap is there in edges adhesive could have been stronger popio has great screen guard at much better price see if you own an iphone then popio is the best out there got this tempered glass because my last one broke during fall from the stairs my last one was from popio too so odered another the prices are steal like seriously wonder how do they manage it for so cheap buy it without doubt its genuine product ps like little note they left with the product fed up of buying those exaggerated priced tempered glasses and looking for near by shops to apply it this product is priced for its value and lesser than other products in the market bought this product after scrolling for the best on amazon and ordered it honestly was never satisfied with any other product like had with popio product big thanks to the team bonus is diy never tried anything self before but after following their guide and videos was able to do it right at first time really felt diy is convenient and no need to worry about finding near by stores who could help us apply install it got it for my iphone pro im using my phone with ringke camo case and this screen protector fits inside snug install this glass with the case still on the phone else you may align it imperfectly and may cause fitment problem overall good buy the quality is excellent refer to the installation video by scanning the qr code on the package it is very easy to install using the guide stickers the quality is good and it covers the screen entirely leaving just enough space on the edges for the cover,positive

its really good best stand from others in price in stability and in branding look work with both big screen and laptop side by side by using this can bring up the laptop screen to the same level as the big screen which actually reduced my neck pain it really sturdy light weight as well very good product using it since while now maybe close to year very portable this is practically something in my laptop bag the slotted angles are very good and pretty convenient and comfortable to use the laptop in also use it for my ipad and this works like charm like the build quality it is good it is sturdy it is light weight and came with good pouch to carry one area of improvement you always need both the hands to adjust the height with laptop off and if you are moving it the level of height adjustment will collapse would have liked if the height was lockable so that if you are moving the stand will not collapse the produt is good value for money its better you get wooden one its hard to adjust feels cheap quality if you have requirement to move it around don buy this if you get some offer and would not be moving this around much good thing to be placed in the corner,positive
its really good product for gamers would recommend it good mouse overall price is little high have been using this mouse since and have to say logitech built quality is second to none have throwed and bashed this mouse on my table during my gaming sessions yet this mouse still survives even the rubberised grips are still there go for it without any hesitation for those having button issues have so far replaced my left click and middle click button started developing these issues after years it simple soldering job to fix it you can get replacement switches from tanotis now they work as good as new so ve been using this mouse for quite long time and believe this is the best mouse so far ve ever used but the problem is with the cable as another customer said the cable quality is not good the outer portion of cable from usb and from mouse side coming out and the inside wires can be visible even though mouse runs good but this is not good for long term usage other than this is pretty good mouse we have at close to it is ridiculously heavy for fast paced gaming for chill rpg titles it ll do fine but if you wanna play something like apex legends on this forget it the shape of the mouse is super comfortable only mouse ve owned that didn give me any wrist pain even after hours continuous usage cable quality is what you expect like it not even braided since it an older generation mouse it doesn have the double clicking issue logitech is infamous for after all that would say in just don buy it it too old to justify spending any money on you know and love logitech this is one of their best products say this is hands down my favorite budget gaming mouse it nice and comfy works properly and also has multiple buttons to assign them to various actions which is not just limited to games you can assign them to windows actions as well have been using this for the last years and have absolutely no complaints although my brother thinks that it looks like beetle,positive

its very nice heater but if want to warm up ur room this is not something should buy this heater is just for warm atmosphere around or near you overall its nice good product excellent product the build is lightweight but the rods are not attached firmly the top rod came off the hinges and stopped working in less than month it did not even fall down and the only movement is from one corner of the room to the other it too late to return now so using it with just the lower rod but really wasted my money on this good product use heaters all the time ve used havells orpat and usha in the past but hilton is by far the best generates good amount of heat better than other heaters ve used it also good looking one definitely going to stick to this from hereon writing this so more people give this try and this great product gets its due appreciation im using since week must say its very good best in the market heating power is very poor,neutral
its very strong remote ordered other remotes earlier which were very delicate this one is working perfect and having good durability good it is value for money quality average but serves the purpose the remote is not of great quality though it does its work sometimes it gets stuck and we need to wait for few seconds before the buttons work the buttons are hard hence its not comfortable simple remote to replace original sony bravia tv remote does the job brilliantly lives up to product promise did not work with my led tv model kdl ex want to return it suits perfectly to sony bravia led ke liyen full use this remote information book nahi mili iske sath,neutral
its worth it at this price the product is very nice and easy to use for beginners also kids love and enjoy while working these wonderful acrylic colors ordered these to use for painting wooden ornaments with my year old niece and her friend was pleasantly surprised because the price was good for what received these are glass jars and full to the top we were able to pour out little drops onto paper plate palettes and there is lot of paint left the paint mixed well to make custom colors this paint would also work well for lots of craft projects including painting art pictures on paper on rocks or shirts too good product it quality is very high and very good for kids also it really cheap used it on canvas liked how the colors are vibrant and unique love the colours easy to use and are waterproof the quality is good good deal at this price,positive

just got delivered theres lag in remote it takes like secs after pressing the remote key like said when you cant find the original remote to buy this can be handy no voice communication it is acceptable for the price inr works as intended however buttons require additional force as it hard the best thing about the remote is obviously that it worked no problems just put in the batteries which honestly should have been included and it worked the flip side is that the fit and finish is atrocious it so badly finished that when first saw it thought it was fake it couldn possibly be real but for the price and the function it was perfect not good because far not remote tv near tv only voice recognition is not available with this remote control so return the item rest item is good for rest of the things good remote ir censor and good buy instead of buying bluetooth one you can buy this one with affordable price ok for emergency keys are hard and might not work after months but is compatile with tcl android inch tv,neutral
just received as of now looks good in this price range will use it for few months and update the review batteries has leaked inside the packing had to put new ones wonderful scale means great look good accuracy very lightweight and skinny and easy to store and very easy to clean so far so good but the durable stainless steel construction is just half true promise only the top plate is obviously some metal but the body is also obviously plastic would not even mind about this little deviation between promise and reality we all know how marketing messages have to be read but the durable stainless steel top plate fell apart from the remaining plastic part of the machine after not even months of use seems it was simply somehow glued on top with glue strips and the glue doesn work anymore due to whatever reason didn remove it it just fell apart during vertical storage just so after only months of use weighting still works when press the metal plate correctly back on top but as soon as store it the plate separates itself again from the other part assembling that thing again and again for every single use is pain and not what expected that why give finally another brand chance after complete my review this time no more durable stainless steel construction wanted let me try different construction which is even some hundreds of bucks cheaper than this thing here both prices reduced today if it keeps months without breaking it good deal compared to this one isn it plastic the product received is good just started using it will update in the future about it pros and cons easy to use good product it is referred to me by my friend who is using it for months and he is very much sure about the accuracy of this and then he reffered to me very value for money,positive
keyboard is good don really like that clicking sound of mechanical keyboard as am software developer and write codes most of the time some times that mechanical sound really irritiates and sometimes seems stressing out my fingers this keyboard is good works as wanted it to be but the real issue is while am digging my code with mouse keyboard light goes off and need to click caps or num key to lit it again its not an issue for average user but irritates me as sometime forget to turn on num lock and while typing number in my code accidentally change edit mode to insert due to pressed otherwise all seems ok wish hp had offered always on option for this keyboard if there is any wrist support this product will skyrocket in its price range good product for this price range rgb light is elegant and good quality keys and its built smooth keystrokes uneven distribution of the backlight over the font causing hard to read keys only time when all keys are properly readable is when you look at it directly at perpendicular angle since don need to look at the letters for normal everyday typing can get away with it there are no indication in the keyboard for the fn function key combos usually in other keyboard there are symbols in the function keys to indicate what they do when pressed with fn overall it seems to be acceptable good and value for money the silver coating came off after days does the purpose of back lit and typing for typing not that great buy keyboards that are less mechanical for that this is good buy doesn give the ease of typing style as in laptop,positive

kw huge consumption rest is ok and control is only by flow of water so you cannot set temprature and wastage of water is little more have been using it since february here are some points where it failed my expectations the temperature doesn remains constant not we can set it at particular temp the water flow is very restricted and takes more than mins to fill the bucket of completely where as the geyser we used earlier bought from local shop could be set at particular temp as we can adjust in stove and the water flow was also comparatively more faster than this this instant electric water tap is awesome this tap working properly by this seller packaging is awame and complete with user manual also liked it must purchase the product from this seller very good product as expected lack of mannual temp control loved it fine quality,neutral
lead should be strong had fantastic first day experience with this product and because of the wire it works so quickly plan to use it more often it an excellent product at this price does what it promises to do the best thing about it is that it made in india and runs on electricity and not batteries immediately tried it on two lowers that had lot of peeling on them it cleaned them in no time and made them new again would recommend it for every household use full to remove lint very useful and affordable purchase makes the cloth as new after using it easy to use and does what it claims worth the purchase the product works well and does the work it promises build quality looks good too and it is easy to use it is easy to use,positive
led is good however the stand that is shipped with the product seems to be manufactured in some local gaziabad street side factory the quality and precision are so bad that even this can hold the led properly this product helps in making video professionally and really value for money nice product pros product quality is good sturdy feel and good fitting medium size is better light intensity is okay but can be even better wire length is okay mobile holder is sturdy and fits well height for ft person is okay cons rgb is not that good very low light not that easy to dismantle as sometimes it becomes wobbly while handling not bad worth for money but built quality improved required in inner thread to plastic mould place lightweight yet sturdy enough can select different height according to your requirement ring light is not very bright even at it highest setting but if you even have moderate lighting in the room pics video will turn out good good for beginners,positive

let me start with something no one writes about ui power on hold the center button for seconds and the earphones with say in japanese indian woman voice power on battery about she does not sound chinese like the cheap chinese headphones her voice volume level is not very high either bt pairing turn off the headset press and hold to center button but keep holding the same button the headsets voice will say bluetooth pairing once connected it will say bluetooth connected if bt disconnects the voice says bluetooth disconnected next track press and hold the button for seconds and the headset will make cute chime and load the next song in the playlist of any app like this feature of the chime because this way know the headset has accepted the command and loading the next track however holding the button for second everytime you want to change songs can get annoying and painful if you want to skip couple of songs of just skipping endlessly waiting for the right song to play buttons aren very soft but do have tactile click to ensure you feel the click when pressed power off just like power on hold the center button for seconds and the headset will turn off volume up down no audible feedback just volume increase or decrease status led blue when on and slow blinking when connected to bt when in pairing mode the same light blinks quickly in the same blue colour orange while charging solid on green off and above physical clues tiny nub on the left ear plug to denote left side only reputed brands have it same tiny bump is made in the volume up button on the controller to denote volume coloured dots on the plastic controller to denotr left and right channel ear plugs are colour coded and fit very well in my ears most of the ear plugs fall out of my ears while talking these don use the smallest one what does sony offer very neat guide on how to insert the ear plugs in your ears the most comfortable way and ensure the best seal for clear audio ve never known that you can pull you ear up from the top corner and gently place the ear plug into your ear canal once placed comfortably drop the ear and let the ear canal seal in audio app it basically music player designed to detect the sony earphones if you use spotify you can use this app to setup an equaliser it plays mp from your storage too my phone already has built in equalizer don use any eq because the sound stage on these is flat so all types of audio sounds great faqis it flimsy no but feels like you might damage it if you re not careful does it really last hr yes ve tested it sort of and never managed to run out of battery how much did you spend on it audio lag none tested it with android tv lg web os android phone ps and pad no issues of lag or disconnection or audio drop on super quiet moments of the song bass very decent and controlled vocals very clear treble sharp and crisp loudness you can listen at full volume without much discomfort but suggest not to compared it with jbl wave tws the sound is very similar but we bit less bass on flat eq better than boat airdopes better than one plus bullets after using it for week returned it here my understanding pros music quality mids and highs are well defined if want can add bass from eq that also provides bass with quality not boomy and unsubtle fast pairing pairs instantly hardware level eq can tweek it to your own desire good mic quality cons no multi pair support can switch between ur lap and mobile instantly or in standby cable quality the provided cable are so thin and fragile causes me to restrict my movements on wearing no magnetic tips for auto play pause if wear it to sleep it can be turned off by simply removing and sticking it together like other neackbands have to use or phone or the buttons to pause the music conclusion returned it and bought realme neackband though it was horrible boosted bass and mediocre sound quality simply because of better features but still prefer the sony on music quality grip to the ear need to improve good the product is well packed and tamper proof packed with sony hologram in the box cons this is compatible with new edge bluetooth version so might not work with old phones like in my case with sony plus and xperia works with redmi pro in my case this is not exactly band but lr connected with thik wire which might fall if jumping or during workout sound is lower to sony wired headphones pros clear and balance sound with sony quality music hearing experience base feels sufficient and clear not like uncomfortable the connecting wire instead of hard plastic band makes it light flexible and weightless to wear and packing in the luggage mic clearity is pure and your voice is very clear and sharp to the front person not like others it complete value for money as this is perfect in its quality which many brands in this price tag is not able to do this can be folded and packed in conclusion go for it if you are riding and puting this inside ur collar not open else it will fly not suggested for gym as it will fall function are smart and easy to use simply it gives you the best quality at this price and connectivity with mobile is strong too not for magic expecters you tube insta the voyager ad sound quality is good battery life is great with good sound quality audio quality of phone call is poor keep this in mind if you are using this product more for calling quality of the product and its sound is good but it always slips from the neck there is nothing to hold it in place keeps falling and am afraid might lose it,neutral
lg was always good correct delivery good service but sound quality was poor the speakers were fitted below the tv no clear sound that was the only problem good video good vice picture quality is awesome good at that price okay product the os has lags after about year of use this is the best you can get for the price tag it comes with like it best one when it comes to bugdet easy installation and handy features good,positive
light weight easy to hold clicks are little hard sleep mode fine there switch on the back just remember this is not silent mouse and will make loud click sounds worthy easy to handle product is completely satisfied from portronics never thought that this company would be near to hp or dell if we talk about computer peripherals but portronics changed my thinking appreciate this mouse is good and working smoothly value for money good pricing light weight and excellent functionality sleep mode is good should be used with duracell pros design is good small and comfortable to use sleep mode is very effective can save battery cons if your mouse in bag and you turn on your pc it will get connected and stay on if clicks are happening due to movement inside bag not that much silent clicks hp mouse was better even with this effective sleep mode its battery gets drained too fast conclusion its good for use and for money but if you re working professional would suggest buy an rechargable mouse can save your spends on aa battery and your ways to shop nice product its have on off switch for saving battery life and product is fine according to price,positive

lights inbuilt in this create psychological effect as they changed according to the quality of air but apart of that no visible change have witnessed yet bought it after reading lot of reviews it is boxy in shape but no nonsense and powerful air purifier easy to assemble easy to clean and good air flow the silent mode will be more than sufficient if it is pm that you re trying to get rid of the purifier is so effective that it draws out moisture also so do not be surprised if you feel dry throat in the morning run it for few hours in silent mode and then switch it off to avoid the dehumidifier effect worth the price and great customer service am extremely happy with this purchase the purifier is very sensitive to impure air and makes sure to trigger purification of highest level to bring the aqi down under good quality the hepa filter has longer life than most other products also the aqi indicator is through at led indicator that is more accurate than the digital interface which comes with other products the installation and functioning is extremely simple and can be done in minutes the best part is the support you receive from coway the day the delivery from amazon was supposed to happen got call from support executive intending to help with installation and related things follow up call was also made to describe more the product comes with yr warranty and additional two years was provided upon registration my flatmate also purchased the same after seeing mine functioning good only drawback found is that it does not show any reading for the pollution level after turning it on in auto mode it turns from red to orange and then to green within mins but showing the pollution level along would have been more convincing wanted no non sense machine for the children bedroom to control and allergies and dust especially during the winter smog season here in lucknow my kids are happy with the machine since it is very easy to use and am happy since it seems quite easy to maintain as compared to the other brands models rajnish gave nice quick demo of how to use it and maintain the device and also how to register for the yr warranty for now am quite satisfied with the service and the product got this product as second purifier in home amazed to see the performance with simplistic looks and no jaziness works well think two things can be enhanced provide handle to move the product around and color option rest all no complaints for testing opened the windows and then ran this purifier and in the same room kept my dyson to monitor aqi level within mins it brought down the aqi level in room which was monitored by dyson happy with the quality and highly recommended,positive

like the price where it comes and the features it offers but one thing din like is its plastic fan can cover the quality of the plastic used to give protection is very light due to which it can break easily so we have to carefully lift the product the cost cutting is done in plastic build over all the product is fine concern for inlet pipe folds hampering the water flow foam container too small so contains half water half froth must do something for this considering customers the product is working fine as expected and the pressure is also good for in house cleaning purposes like two bikes and two cars recommend product the inlet pipe blue color quality is not up to the mark and also reset button is missing on the product received but later contacted the customer care and found out that received an updated version and it doesn need reset button the warranty period of months is too short for such an item high noise and machine heating to high only bucket filter are missing please send me the bucket filter only immediately don wont to return as soon as possible send me bucket filter only like this machine send me reply thnk everyone shd have it it not only to clean your or any vehicle even you can clean washroom flooring in minutes good product best under,positive

like this product the product is good my only complaint is regarding the cells along with the machine the cell were sent separately which were of no use had to purchase them separately when bought it worked really well light weight and portable makes it convenient to use initially it was great product not sure what happened after few months it was difficult to tare when switch on and display shows zero immediately after it start moving to minus and takes long time to tare back to zero which makes it annoying and inconvenient also not sure about its accuracy seeing this instability to tare good product for kitchen item accurate and easy to carry loved it great same day delivery of item received just now also very user friendly no issues in usage with batteries included all inside that good enough good quality thanks,neutral
like this value for money compared to other company overall is good product good product that is value for money not that high speed as shown in videos not satisfy with the speed over all its easy to use easy to install the product mechanism is like any other exhaust fan in the market realized that the size of the exhaust fan doesnt really have noticeable impact on suction power of air nonetheless its drawbacks are that because of the small space between the fan blades it is ultimately impossible to clean any dust oil buildups on the inside rods and the shutter walls the only way to clean the aforementioned areas is from the posterior side of the exhaust fan which is difficult to reach in most housing situations ok good quality and works as per my requirement not that great,positive
liked because it was aesthetically pleasing thought it was thicker but overall it ok go for it you can buy but don go for printing it is short copy you can use it as diary like its sharpness and style liked it product is good but thought it is pad but small but good notebook is good,positive
liked easy set up disliked having to download and app and create account an awesome product this covers floor plus terrace in sqft house you can buy this product without any concern would suggest you to have tp link router too to be bought along this for seemless experience product is good have received the product from amazon in pristine condition and it works very well as described am using it in my first floor room where have low signal for my wifi and gets disconnected when close the doors the extender helps to resolve the issue and configuration was also really easy one of the only minor issue is at very random times rarely this gets automatically disconnected but can be reconnected easily by going to wifi settings of device everything is nice except range good item using in my bhk home as getting weak wifi network from router and slow internet speed it is easy to setup and does increases range as well as speed tremendously than original router option of gext works great horizontal range is quite good as for vertical range at height of st floor is perfect and on nd floor its manageable doesn heat not heat that much surely go for it little costly but worth it use the tether app do the installation by yourself enjoy the wi fi helped improve network connectivity in my house value for money do look out for this product during seasonal sale for better deal,positive
liked everything like product quality packaging was so premium one thing didn liked is you can get fingerprint easily standard cover for the price need little common sense to apply could use help of your local shops decent product could be little cheaper spen works after applying good product though bit costly not smudge proof at all but apart from that it the glass fits perfectly around the screen it is completely transparent and has no black edges cutout for the front cam is perfect as well very easy to install the screen guard is of good quality but it sometimes creates problems in writing with the pen not an issue but just for the information overall good and value for money the seller is basically lying by saying anti scratch and smudge proof as it is clearly not pros durable not cracks during year of use cons heavy smudge that you have to wipe constantly and scratches appear with regular use,positive
liked that it is so convenient to carry waste of money defective product cheap quality doesnt blend at all charge problem second motor proble,negative
liked the design and the built of kettle the price is also affordable easy to use very useful product for winter ltr qty is sufficient for members this is an excellent product and user friendly have used it for years and still continuing now want my kettle to be repaired or exchange if needed reason after three months it stop heating or you can say stop working thank you after month of use the bottom plastic emits charring smell affecting the water taste thru their app logged complaint the gentleman who is in contact with me is asking for an invoice could not provide on time due to the mobile amazon app did not support to download received call from customer service about canceling the service ticket later contacted the service engineer he said nothing worked he ordered the part someone will visit to replace no action raised another ticket still in open status with no effort may approach the national consumer helpline for action easy to clean but not everyone can use kind of heavy the price is reasonable water capacity is sufficient and boiling is fast used first time inalsa electric kettle will update review after one month of usage best product high quality product which is so convenient to use the design is so nice and presentable that it can be used to serve directly to guests at home or office,positive
liked the product accurate to my usb apparatus good value till now had purchased about cables both micro and type for myself and my family in this last one year its all because this brand wins my trust by provinding great quality with reasonable price na tested with amps charger and phone gives full amps power to phone the cable looks thick and it has nice texture despite that am sure it is not very durable the usb connectors are extremely sturdy and they dont bend or flex the wire will break before the connector does warning usb micro connector has strong hook be careful while plugging and unplugging or you may damage your device very cheap and usable cable for rs super power nice product in this price this is the best one,positive
liked this product for laptop perfectly working good very good mouse for budget setup usefull gud quality the good thing about this mouse is that can remove the scrolling clip attached inside the scrolling wheel and the wheel becomes very smooth to scroll the best of this mouse is its quality as per description its totally worth it best for professional usage if searching for gaming also suitable but dont have dpi options so for advance gaming you can search something else may be logitech best mouse with dpi options else go with this,positive
liked top notch display gorgeous display heavyly and seriously powerful device thanks to gen tremendous battery life in heavy usage super cool device silky buttery experience with blazing fast performance good sound quality the form factor is really good mean the screen is flat so it feels like wide not actually wide but feels like phone also it is tall that why it really feels good at hand have an pad but all the work now can be done by phone so am happy didn like it as had op loved oxygen os but now it feels like realme ui camera is worst for this price main sensor is good other two are useless company should provide telephoto lens in this price range had op and previously op both camera were good op camera is exactly same as nord conclusion if you looking for speed performance battery life longevity best of display premium feel then go for it if you are looking for op experience like an alert slider or good camera then please don choose this either can wait for the next op or go for other devices if you don bother about ui experience oxygen then go for iqoo its far better in spec go to gsmarena compare op and op exactly same specification except processor and charging speed this much fast charge is not required by excluding important spec am one plus user since their st phone have used one plus one plus nord nord ce nord and now have been using as my primary phone since last month everytime one plus never fails to impress with their new phone but this time you would feel something is missing may be because one plus has already raised their bar so much that user always expect more from them when saw first time somewhere in my subconscious mind had taken my decision to buy this beast but before reviewed so may phones from one nord to phone my ratings design and build camera quality battery backup and charging time performance undoubtedly design and build is unmatched so sturdy and beautiful camera quality might be discussion point they should have given more in camera because phone comes in high range and premium level but current camera is not so bad noone can beat it battery charging time and backup time within min to highly impressive it will survive around day for average user performance is good installed and ran multiple apps at time never faced any hung issue or app carsh issue as said even if wow factor is missing this time would say good phone with nice overall performance design and features if you get it in sale around it good deal go for it nothing to regret purchased it some days ago switched from my asus so had really high expectations and well it did perform somewhat close to it but also many downgrades as well just gonna list as pros and cons pros mean snapdragon gen you can expect amazing performance why not top tier since it the best processor android could offer well cause feel the processor on this one is under clocked to reduce heating but it holding up pretty good in terms of gaming and other benchmark tests and stuff build quality is actually good especially the back the back does feel amazing and while holding it does feel like premium phone expect for the frame ofc it made of polycarbonate but we can get hang to it later software not gonna sit around and cry about their merging with oppo feel it fast and good ui of course some old features not available now since ve used one plus in the past for some weeks but we can get hang to this new oxygen os just hope it not completely turned to color os charging is just insanity on this one switching from phone which used to take around hours to get fully charged to this one almost finishing full charge under minutes and ve witnessed it several times it just impressive but some issues and ll talk about it in cons networking and connecting is fast and good haven faced any major issues in my networking experiences calling is good experience connecting with networks and bluetooth is extremely fast good overall cons about the processor like said it is under clocked and the benchmark scores proved it bit although don care about benchmark scores and just want to keep my belief in real life usage so it is doing good polycarbonate frame and no alert slider like really at least we deserved metal frame at this price segment which is what upset me bit not really big fan of alert slider so didn mind that part the camera setup is so so so average and stupid aside from the main lens the wide and macro just did not make sense at all and are completely worthless in this segment this is literally the same setup from nord but just better software optimisation front camera is alright too nothing that great charging indeed is one of the key factors in this phone but it takes toll on the battery backup usually in my usage have to charge it times for it to be used the whole day it drains bit more than expected it to also there no option available to disable charging to let it charge in usual speed to test the battery only except for the night optimisation mode which is kind of good in my opinion phone is good segment in this price range and if you do believe in the particular brand image and it products then go for it although iqoo does provide better camera setup with bit more aggressive processor performance but this device does the job too so basically am reviewing it after usage of month and days am giving it star because of alert slider missing let me clear it by points battery is awesome it will get full charge in minutes seconds it lasts more than hours to me camera quality is nice specially night mode is awesome some improvements should be done for selfie camera but it clicks nice picture no lagging no hang it runs smoothly and very fast only thing that disappoints is alert slider that is missing in this phone video quality is awesome while you record and it is stable while watching any ott streaming quality is awesome you can fully enjoy it speaker of phone is perfect even at lowest volume you can clearly hear the voice on call,positive
likeit looks like quality has been considered well in all respects after around weeks one cutter got jam so don know how to claim warranty everything here look cheap take on your own risk easy to use reasonable cost looks good makes less noise jars are light weight one should buy it nice product nice good product any one can buy,neutral
linking the smart watch to my mobile phone was not as seamless as is to be expected for such product once it was set up it works flawlessly however the noise smartwatch app on my google does not give any data on sleep cycles and neither is there any information on how to transfer the data to another useful app such google fit noise pulse max smart watch is awesome and looks good only one default battery life days is coming with notifications without notifications it is coming upto days packaging was not proper the package having full of oil in the package but the brand packaging was proper so no issues with the product after using more than months the product is really impressive and having good battery life and accuracy and the quality of calls on smartwatch are the best ve been using the product for while now and gotta say love it the battery lasts around days not days you do get around day battery life if you disable almost all the features of the watch like heartrate sensing and not connecting it with your phone the watch requires more software support and they should add more watch faces nice product value for money totally good product the calling feature at such price point is definitely plus the health features are bit not upto the mark but manageable the screen is responsive but bit low res,positive
lital bit ok good design but china product it changes the angle and gets loose in few days only very poor quality it worth and good quality very good quality like the quality of the phone holder its amazing,neutral

look good the product is good does what it says especially to mention about their customer service and replacement policy which is too good with year warrenty kudos to the team overall great product had this fear before buying that how good it will adhere but it doing fantastic the only field where they had scope of improvement is the plastic quality it decent but could have been better good except minor noise rest all good stayed well overall through rough drive of km and seems sturdy enough to last long however the nuts at the joints needed tightening times during the trip and there are few rattles too quality product with affordable price used this for swift dizre model working good condition and specially it has the lower hook so it hold good nice one if you looking for buget segement just buy it,positive
look of the item is not impressive need to improve cord length is not sufficient it should be bouble of the existing length got this kettle yesterday but it got scratches on it and this kettle is bit noisy and automatic switch off is not working nice good work maza agya liked most easy to use had gifted the item but now think shouldn have the item came with loose handle when kept water for boiling the whole unit was hot including the handle and lid it is not stopping automatically when water is boiled over all total waste of money didn expect from such poor company best price,neutral

my isp provided modem router combo is in another location in the house and was getting speed drops on ghz when was across the house as was expected so decided to buy this router to use as an access point the setup is pretty straightforward provided you know what you are doing as is mentioned on the product page this router comes with two modes router mode and access point mode if you are using it in addition to your isp provided modem router would suggest using it in the access point mode only the range and the speeds are working better than expected for the price certainly better than the router that the isp provides the router does come with lan cable but the quality of the cable is not very confidence inspiring the leds on the front can be configured via the tether app to switch off at specific times which is neat feature apart from that have found tether app to be pretty useless it doesn specify the device identity for some reason just shows the ip and unknown until you rename the device yourself sometimes it doesn even list all the devices connected guess it is better to use the router settings from the browser itself if you want to dig into the settings would like to add one more thing in the end this router looks pretty slick and don think it has gotten enough credits for that kept on the table or even hung from the wall it looks and feels premium for the price and that is in addition to all the amazing features it has router gets sometime auto disconnected even though it is connected to internet don have any issue with router but sure with amazon packaging method bcz no paper bag or anything were used it was only the box good product for that price good range so far everything looks good ill update the review after few months of usage awasome experience go for it with out any hasitation assistance also very good highly recommended to purchase overall good purchase you will never regrate after purchasing it signal strength can be improved further so far good to go,positive
my lg smart tvs magic remote went kaput and since lgs magic remotes are super pricey decided to give this one try besides the air mouse and motion gestures everything else works absolutely fine also the lightweight remote and its form factor feels really nice and cozy in hands however the buttons have no dots or rivets over its buttons which sometimes makes you forget which key you are pressing other than that its great remote controller this product is good for work from my box tv having my original magic remote go kaput was not sure if this remote would work on my inch lg smart tv however huge relief it works and works like smooth operator using the keys no need of any set up etc it doesn have voice or scroll button but anyways was not using that feature in my original magic remote since that consumes batteries to great extent forcing you to change batteries every days don waste money buying expensive ones go for this functionally very good and it is good replacement for the original remote on which the power switch had stopped working haven had to use most of the other functions good performance cheap and best alternative for your lg remote magic mouse option is not there but works fine with my lg tv works as expected the response is little slow but that still fine,positive
my office pc ups legrand numeric ups digital ex is having only one led and beep codes this is not sufficient if we want more details however the unit is robust easy to disassemble easy to replace battery with generic battery having best transfer time less than milli sec min backup for cpu monitor when checked in view of this the legrand numeric ups digital ex should my the number one choice but it also has low user ratings the following brands came to my notice on search apc bx in apc bx ci in emerson liebert ton cx have not considered microtek intex iball vguard etc may be they are good the technical parameters of the above all looked similar like generator compatibility avr high low overload protections but the transfer time specified for numeric is less than milli sec for apc milli sec typical and for liebert milliseconds apc bx in is selected as my requirement is not for pc or laptop further search is not done for ups with communication port and auto save software and in view of better interface power led dual color charging led dual colour battery saver led it also has better backup and surge power than apc bx ci in minus resettable thermal relay based on the reviews there are four major issues have noticed very old stock battery capacity expected to be in reduced condition resulting into low backup time or battery issue transit damages as it is bulky to its volume though it is better to purchase such items offline still tried online in view of remote location no load protection it acts if very low load is connected just modem or less than and battery saver mode is on after min people get confused it as giving only min backup it shouldn be considered as problem once known since additional loads can be connected or battery saver mode can be unselected if battery saver is enabled it shutdowns while min juice still left it shouldn be considered as problem since it can be unselected if selected intentionally or unintentionally to reduce the above risks appario retail private ltd was chosen at lightening deal at rs rs the order was placed on the product is delivered in days on the original packing was wrapped in repeated turns of polyethylene the packing reached without any major distortions the original cartoon packing was in sealed condition however when it was opened some parts looseness sound was coming from the ups the same was reported to apc service center they registered the complaint and told me that the service person will visit within hours of working days further they have given clearance to put the ups in service first it was charged fully while ups in off condition charging light was on while charging and it became off after charging now the ups was made on by power button it is to be pressed and hold for not less than second before release or release after beep tone connected to pc with inch led tv initially some repeated chattering without any power interruption to the load was happening if power input is kept off on battery it was happening some times when it is on battery beep sound was occurring every sec against apc manual spec of sec it withstood for minutes for the pc with inch led tv on battery battery save mode was in off condition further it got switched off within sec of low battery alarm against sec specified in the manual the manufacturing date as per slip glued on original packing was nov photo attached but the test and quality passing date is hrs photo attached as my load is more than can put it on battery saver mode the battery saver button to be pressed and hold for not lessthan seconds before release to change the state this is minor but the holding time is no where written in the manual the ups body temperature appears to be on higher side when compared to numeric installed at office under similar ambient temperature while on load with input mains as well as while in off condition without charging but connected to mains the above is initial experience only any updates shall be shared in future note this item isn eligible for return for safety reasons items containing flammable liquids or gases can be returned to amazon for more information or help please contact them if you want return facility search for other alternatives update the service person called me on and informed about his planned visit on the service person visited in the morning of and disassembled the ups there was minor play with the battery the whole casing is of plastic one side cover opens including top as one part the play may be due to design manufacturing tolerances the pcb and the transformer were already firmly fastened to body and all connections were also tight hence the looseness is acceptable the battery manufacturing date was oct agreed for his optional proposal to replace with new sealed battery but manufactured in sept the chattering may be relevant to building wiring as it is not happening with main sockets in other rooms or if we remove ups input plug from the same socket see next update for accurate reason in the whole the service persons only concern was hotter transformer based on his experience but it will be replaced only if it fails prompt response of service center is appreciable that too for an interior of km from service center located at state capital and it compliments the non return policy update it is fully charged with replaced battery and backup time was tested with the same load as above but this time large improvements were observed in the backup time and parameters difficult to reason out as below backup time is min until some different type of blinking of power led different type of beeps happens for few seconds may be relevant to battery saver mode and however it got normalized in auto after min further the battery low blinking of power led occurred hence total min against min of earlier experience as above and these beeps occurred for seconds before it tripped against seconds of earlier experience as above but power led was glowing for every few seconds till further seconds in off condition battery on beep was occurring for every seconds min to indicate the load is on battery against every second earlier experience as above was totally involved with service person as it has to protect very costly bulky and distant service partner type equipment at my home he has replaced only battery and he has not even removed the pcb but how so many wonders have happened is yet to be analyzed and reasoned out note non rms multimeter does not properly read the voltage of ups that uses stepped approximated output sine wave while on battery hence output voltage of vac ups is measured to be between vac when on battery ii low voltage cut off will act if any separate low voltage high voltage cutoff protection is used at outlet of ups while on battery iii chattering may take place at ups if any separate surge protection is used at ups outlet iv some body already advised not to use any surge protection at input to upsv apc service person informed that apc ups will not on if house is not properly grounded earthing is to be proper to protect from surges vi if ups is on battery with battery saver mode enabled mains off it will give only min backup to loads less than as no load protection acts however if the load is more than it shutdowns while min juice still left if we disable battery saver mode we will get min more backup power from the above the ups is now functioning as per specifications but one star of apc is reduced against initial issues of equipment though super fast response exists from their service center stars to appario retail private ltd the seller stars to the apc service center and stars to courier delivery for safe and fast delivery update after months of use backup time testing ignoring erroneous tests in between the ups was made on and battery saver was made off due to this the ups started self charging further and have waited till the charging is completed now the tv as monitor with pc were made on it took upto amp during cold boot amp measured with clamp meter while mains is on once the pc stabilised the mains is switched off now it gavea backup of minutes with beep every minute and given repeated beeps at th min again every min one beep started for min after this repeated beeps occurred for second and ups got tripped hence got minutes and seconds in total in view of this the star rating is retained at star one more observation is that it transformer temperature is high while it is on battery that means more energy is being wasted by transformer got the battery replaced one more time on under warranty as backup time reduced to min under the same conditions and load with new battery am getting minutes hence the apc is being letdown by battery manufacturer where apc quality person should have control after warranty will install battery from exide and see pros the device is sleek small and blends into the environment cons makes lot of noise bought this primarily to support my television sony xr to handle the switch from generators to mains for secs it is not sufficient to do that and the tv switches on and off continuously when running on ups power not sure what the problem is as the wattage is sufficient if you have similar use case as mine better consult local inverter shop and get ups that fits your requirement else you will end up with dead weight easy to install my pc has psu with bronze effeciency but installed components are not supposed to go beyond watts under max load this ups shuts down as soon as my gpu gtx reaches then used it for my printer but as soon as hit print the ups shuts down so it useless there as well now it attached to my tv router and speakers atleast can watch netflix uninterrupted getting trouble in this think this is not working properly where should return value for money so far working good small but big life of battery it is good for electricity stability,neutral
my only concern is longevity so let see how long this one lasts otherwise it quite quite useful especially during winters good looking but light weight not easy to clean nice product bought this as it is made in india it is light weight which is good and does its job well the lid must be manually opened and must be pushed all the way up to hold initially it fell back but it needs to be push back to hold upright position am happy with itafter using it for two days except for the cord length of the kettle which should be bit more otherwise thank you for good product very nice good working heats well less noisy and looks elegant cord is short and partially opening lid makes it difficult to clean has worked well so far,positive
my review of using new vacuum mop pro for days the product is bit tricky to setup with the app and you have to follow you tube videos to get it setup wish xiaomi provides video tutorial links in their user manuals they don mention it but we need bluetooth and wi fi connection to be setup for the app and robot to work together this tip is missing in user manual wi fi connectivity does get lost sometimes but that is because my router is far from certain places in my house that time the robot needs to be brought back to the wi fi range ghz connection does not work with this model the robot takes anywhere between minutes to completely vaccum my sq ft house battery life is really good in the new model or more is still left after one complete sweep or mop cycle of my house charging is also not bad it took hrs for it to charge full the first time couple of times it got confused in specific area in my house and had to reset the entire house map for it to work properly again once the map was created and the device has sweeped and mopped that area for couple of times it would not repeat this behavior dusting is of quality each time the amount of dust collected is staggering we never knew we had so much dust in our house mopping is average would call it light wiping and not mopping hard stains or sticky stains or dry stains are not affected by the mopping only light dust or weak stickiness gets wiped out adding bit of floor cleaning liquid or vim liquid in the water helps vacuum mop mixed mode is limited in its effectiveness in this mode mopping sometimes wets the floor and causes dry dust to stick to the floor which the vaccum is not able to pick up recommend vacuum and mop as two separate cycles keeping mop extension attached to the robot all the time causes mopping cloth to accumulate dirt and when it gets dragged along the floor it causes wet dirty mop to be wiped around the house this is not ideal so it important to remove that extension from the vacuum bot when you are only vacuuming and not mopping the mop works horribly on door mats main door or bathroom mats it gets very dirty when it moves over mats and then that wet dirt spreads all over the place so please remove all the mats esp during mopping session noise levels are pretty low in medium mode sometimes we don even know where it has gone it gets so quiet pros battery life suction power noise levels vacuuming cons mopping is average it at best can be called as light wiping setup is bit tricky user manual is insufficient xiaomi does not contact or send any demo person at home you have to figure it out using you tube videos can see old people or non tech savvy people will highly struggle with this thing once the device is confused it doesn correct itself automatically it needs map reset door mats make the mop even dirtier so please remove them or other items on the floor before mopping such tips nobody gives you and you have to learn them on your own but still recommend this device as it is very effective in sweeping the dust in the house clean pros for cleaning dust it is very good we can set daily schedule even if we forget to do so it will automatically does the work by setting schedule cleaning the box after its work is also not very hectic brushes are providing we can set restricted areas cones most of the hairs threads are stuck through the round main brush little difficult to clear the brush it has been more than year iam using this one time the movement is low when ichecked so many hairs are stucked in its wheel it was little difficult to clear the hair strands mopping it is average only only takes very little amount of water so oily things will remain in the floor once or twice in week we have to do mopping with plenty of water and lizol it can reach the sharp corners also once we create restricted area by the time of using it couldn detect the proper area we marked so it enter those area and get stuck most of the times it is main thing hate about this product remaining things are okay then we have to reset the map and set restricted area again it is bit annoying overall it is very good for me my brooming is almost completely replaced by this once in week do the complete cleaning with broom to all areas that didn covered by this machine in all other aspect like price battery app feature suction and cleaning its really very good product find it very useful and nice to have product so will directly make note of some drawbacks improvent area observed sometimes it gets confused or leaves specific section of bedroom even though there has been no obstacle its little noisy or will say not silent thing in standard suction power though that with any vaccuum cleaner xiaomi could have provides extra hepa filter with it vaccum mop doesn clean properly and rather sticks dust to floor because of wet brush so do vaccum and then only mop subsequently is best option charging is super slow if compared with any ah battery with mobile fast charger its times slower despite such big docking charger am bachelor and do not like maid coming to my house this solves the purpose it is great at vacuuming my sqft house it can do it on turbo mode with dual cleaning in single battery life was surprised with the vacuum power and battery life it collects way more dust than the manual brooming it can skip corners and narrow places once in while just broom the corners and bring the dust in the middle before turning the robot on for navigation and room mapping mopping is equally bad mop does not cover whole area and it leaves trails it leaves the floor looking worse than the un mopped floor also water tank broke in just few cleanings recommended for vacuuming purpose very good product very helpful product in my home we purchased the product in april and now it is not working after charging it is running for less than one minute and getting stopped easy to use and working well little bit of noise is there but acceptable helping hand more reliable than maids does the job well once in days you need to mop yourself good suction power,positive
na good use for getting instant heat water have used it for last months it was still good and no issues very bad product don bye used product received if you don have hot water line installation in kitchen this is the best solution it took min max in installation best for winter use not for bathroom use it only provide lukewarm water which is good enough for washing dishes pro one hot water pipe is provided cons no pipe clamps provided you need inch pipe for cold water line length depends on distance pipe clamps is needed review you can buy it it is working satisfactory but other similar products are selling it with pipe clamps etc so please check first like build quality easy to use but voltage consumption kw it too much average good product,neutral
na slightly imbalance legs overall ok product to use delicately dislike curvy edge is making it hard to stay on the bed it will usually fall if the weight on one end of table is more overall am using it so am used to it now for how to use that but new people will find it problematic the feet are badly designed the table rolls over on the slightest nudge nice product but take more time to deliver value for money stability issues was there in this product it was so sacking its does not full fill all your expectations but provide best quality at these price it is not stable completely,neutral
nd purchase review purchased on july dash charge stopped working on september within months but when contacted them on the given whats app number they right away sent me new cable the very next day stars for keeping the promise and professionalism first purchase review writing after months of usage everything happened as expected and written below after purchase after months cable stopped pc connectivity then after month it started showing problems in charging it used to charge in one position only and charging used to stop with little movement finally had to replace it with new one after months since the price is now reduced to so will say good product in this price not long lasting if you want reliable long lasting long length cable go for original from oneplus showroom initial review written just after purchase yes it supports dash charge and no heating issues using it since days one negative point is short length it is meter long original cable is meters so it is difficult to use my phone while charging other negative point can figure out is that cable is really hard in my experience hard cables break more often than soft pliable ones it is not easy to put hard cable in my bag without putting strain on it for daily commute to office this makes them to break easily before time hard cables are also not easy to use when the mobile is charging it puts strain on both the points the charger side and mobile side which again makes it vulnerable to cracks this raises question on longevity of the cable let do some calculations my original one plus cable lasted for years cost of which at present is rs it was soft easy to bend and keep in my bag while traveling daily for work the rs cable online is meters long which makes it easy to work on phone while it is plugged popio cable costs rs at present but they show it which means price may rise so even if it lasts for months it will be more costly to me than an original cable in years popio cable is meter long against meters of original cable so effective price of popio cable is rs for meter cable popio cable is meters long against meters of original cable which makes it not easy to use the phone while it is charging using short cable while charging puts strain on the cable and phone charging port which is damaging for both and also decreases life of both the cable and charging port they say you have to consider cost while writing review but you should also consider cost on long run not just the immediate cost so if are thinking of changing your phone in coming future and don want to spend too much on cable popio is the best option available but if you are looking for long term solution and you can afford to buy rs cable will suggest to go for the original one it has more length it is soft and it lasts longer with moderate use ordered this cable for in the sale yesterday when plugged in the cable it wasn charging rapidly on my one plus but then immediately booked for replacement cable

network reception is not that great people who call get out of coverage area message even though the phone show two bars of network the same sim and network worked fine in my smartphone can use this as secondary phone or as backup device and cannot rely on it as primary device the only benifit which saw on this is it supports volte and can sync the contacts from android phone which avoid manual taks of creating each contact manually product is average it doesn suck like the many contemporary feature phones from other brands that being said it not great either with some little annoyance noticed don expect much as its feature phone but then some negatives are there voice distortion noticed occasionally when receiving calls have to end the call redo it then the voice is clear initially thought it was an issue of particular product so returned the phone got new one however the new one also has this have tried some methods to rectify this including switching off the volte till now this issue has not cropped up yet thankfully no notepad come on how hard is it to give notepad on this phone if it can do texting contact saving how difficult is it to give notepad to record stuffs no you tube since there no dedicated you tube app tried to access it from the opera browser but to big disappointment it can properly load the you tube page let alone play any video yes it not phone for constant you tube watching but since it very important site not only for entertainment but also for information news it would have been great if youtube was enabled it supports so why not you tube the camera is very bad can expect smartphone standard camera but this vga camera is really bad nokia could have increased the price about bucks give an average megapixel camera on it sometimes we take photos not for posting on social media but for information like the name of store or number of vehicle basic camera that does that job is all that is required was delighted to see an english with oxford app assumed they were very thoughtful to give an offline dictionary but then upon opening it turned out to be demo version with pay inr play free trail was even disappointed when upon clicking the free trail option it required internet was directed to the opera website what the point to this other than this the phone is not bad with some positive features like wireless radio radio recording big screen compared to other feature phones voice recorder torch call recording option converter app stylish retro design good easily typable keypad all os ok but battery life is not good while we not useing single call also but its draining battery life good add on phone battery life is days if usage is not very heavy fm works without wired headphones call quality if good dual nano sim no profile setting option as was the case with previously released nokia feature phones preinstalled games but all except snakes are trial version internet browser facebook music video player are there but no option to install any other app as there is no app store gud for one model in nokia and worth for money bettery not works more than days even not using phone it works like any other feature phones from the time but the build quality is considerably low good battery life and good call quality is there nothing special other than that,neutral

nice product the overall quality of product is good but please mention that we have to use electric cell and how much to use the product is nice in its working the only issue is handling product there is no on off button to start or stop the blender need to keep pressing button to start and release button to stop it also it is battery operated no charging cable connection is available but overall it is working fine for me in this amount just seconds and frothy coffee ready very powerful easy to operate as well the main body of the frother could be made of better material nice product product is ok does decent job of frothing however the built quality appears to be flimsy plastic is quite cheap and delicate have to see how long it lasts also the seller promises cashback for giving star reviews so all the reviews may not be genuine like it because it is easy toh use and dislike because it doesn come with batteries,positive

nice this fan is working fine ive been using it since month the thing which bajaj can improve is the noise level of both motor and while cutting the air design of blades but considering the price its perfect deal comes up with nice looking design and quality low cost but does the job nice good recently purchased for extra room actual performance will can be measured in summer only rpm is less bajaj quality is not maintained bearing sound in the initial start and low speed the trust in bajaj has come down after this purchase the bajaj fan purchased in is still working with out any complaint just changed the capacitor for rs the price is competitive value for money better at this rate,positive

nicey packed easy to install and with good quality adhesive perfectly fit on the screen it well made basic screen protector application can be tricky as it comes with no aligner but the protection it offers is good regards to durability to scratches habe to wait and see observed the finger print recognition is affected bit as it take an extra couple of tries to register the finger print all in all well made economical basic screen protector the tempered is nice and easy to install the adhesion could be better good product at this price range better than other costly tempered glass feels premium touch sensitivity is good with little fear purchased this item for my new pixel to my surprise it perfectly fits the phone and even was able to stick it without any bubbles even the touch reponse and finger print are working flawlessly there is no guide to help you stick the screen guard which is okay as we all know how to do it recommend this product over the overpriced branded screen guards but yes am not sure how it acts in drop and am scared to test it but it feels like it will protect the phone display during an accidental drop does the job thats it,positive
nive very good batteries received like good product good seller durable life great product and good package no damage good value for money delivered timely go for it,positive
no complaints till now only cons is st time connection is lil messy once it connected no need to look back value for money bought it for around on sale quick easy to install good coverage bought this as wifi was not working in my room due to placement of router was very doubtful to buy as it was pricey as per my view but once you buy you can take it with you when you move or shift so it forever product strength of wifi is so good now can watch lectures just install app you can also add or remove people who uses it very manageable bought this as backup extender setting it up was breeze but faced silly self inflicted issue entered wrong wi fi password during setup but setup completed as if the connection to the router was successful when tried to browse it showed no internet connection between the extender and the router it took me some time to troubleshoot and correct the password ideally the setup process should have highlighted the error and stopped the setup process showing the connection to the router was not successful it would have saved me some headache to troubleshoot extender coverage use the extender to reach corner of the house about ft away from the router where get sporadic and weak signal mbps locate the extender about ft away from the router to extend the network and now get connection of mbps it is enough for my work speed test results at the time of testing my laptop recorded speed of mbps next to the router at the point where located the extender ft away when directly connected to the router the laptop recorded speed of mbps at the same point when connected to the extender the laptop recorded speed of mbps only drop not so bad feet away from the extender without direct line of sight the laptop recorded mbps overall am satisfied with its performance for home use but its range is like till one room only it can extend not much but good one like my router is in middle passage in my home but its range doesnt come out much without extender when started using extender it pulls the range till this specific room if your room is one after the other then it wont go till last room extends my wifi signals and does it job very effectively once concern is have actfiber signal but this gives hz only but still managable for tv laptop mobiles etc for home purpose,positive
no doubt product is good but after month product auto power cut funtion not working so try to claim warrenty but havells said talk to amazon and amazon said talk to havells both the comany raise our hand by the way product gave year warrenty but they gave me only excusses very bad experiences with havells never expected its good the ony pro and cons can be the flap pros us can say is that the flap can be used for wider bucket of water for heating cons can say is the again the flaps bcoz while not in use flaps must be closed and you can hang the heater anywhere bcoz there is no option given flaps can cause issue bcoz it have to be kept on the ground while not in use rest all is good auto cut feature is best cord length is short energy efficiency good temperature control too good realt like the design and auto shutoff features of the product but there is also design flaw that you can insert it into the half filled bucket and water should be full awesome very good product energy efficiency is ok not good,positive
no there should be fan speed control option overall very good little noisy but expected fan is slightly noise operating switch is too hard for aged person best in market good product easy to use received days ago looks color good heating nice adjustments for heating whichever require no auto cut or over heat protection available,positive
non returnable so now using this as it is bandwidth control is must for this price range model was archer great delivery from amaozn it was easy to setup as extender signal is also good but not that great it can cover flat well signal breaks if moving upstairs or downstairs overall great purchase must buy need little better customer support good expected much stronger signal meter away its okay working but not as expected tp link is good product good product decided on buying this router from tp link after days of research reading reviews and talking to many people regarding different models was on mbps connection with netgear router since which used to suffice for moderate usage till now however with increase in the number of devices like smart tv pads and laptop etc it necessitated an upgrade also considering the current work from home scenario which is bound to continue for the foreseeable future as well the internet usage was being stretched to it limit and the trusted netgear router simply couldn match up to the increased bandwidth demand to capitalise on the current situation our current isp came out with interesting fibre broadband plans and we opted for mbps connection that in turn needed new router to utilize it optimum potential finally zeroed in on the tp link archer after reading some horror stories of other available routers was also tempted to buy the ax considering there barely any price difference but then came across few reviews which stated that wifi is not entirely successfully implemented and might prove to be an hindrance to use with our current range of devices order delivered by amazon within day full marks for the seamless delivery as always prime has truly been boon installed the router today installation via tether app was seamless isp guy helped with the pppoe sign in process and released the mac id which was bound to our old router the whole process was done in mins and we were online the dual bands are truly boon have divided the devices at home equally between and as per usage as the router is close to the tv unit have connected it to and also alternatively connected via the ethernet cable just in case speed tests started off by streaming content simultaneously on devices connected to played seamlessly even with other devices like mobiles etc being connected have attached few pictures for reference sitting near the router download speed is mbps and upload is mbps speed tested in the bedroom with wall in between download mbps and upload mbps speed in the same room as the router is download mbps and upload mbps this is quite surprising as few reviews mentioned mbps will be the threshold for used to get maximum of mbps download on my old speed test via the ethernet cable provided in thr box connected to the tv download mbps and upload mbps couldn have asked for more really this seems to be totally ideal build quality of the device is decent and the antennas seem well enough to do the job however would have preferred that they were placed like other tp link models like the archer so it would have been easier to move them in preferred directions the led lights are little weirdly placed and not bright enough maybe used to the prominent lights on my old router these are blink and miss sort and you have to bend little to check in case there an issue one big element missing in this device is usb port which is absolutely essential in today age and expected to be included for this price range wonder what the reason behind giving it miss have sealed the extra lan ports with tape to protect from dust or moisture it good practice the outer design of the router is quite sophisticated and stylish however little worried of dust accumulating in the intricate design on the top portion functionally though this seems to be real good offering from tp link hope this device lives up to expectations in coming days all in all seems to be worthy investment for the next few years considering an internet plan upgrade if any hope touched upon major points which might help other interested consumers in making choice this product is recommended,positive

not much durable cannot close proper great for storage the product is as advertised both sides of the bin tend to bulge out when clothes are inside hence the lid might often slip inside the bin the both sides need some support to keep it sturdy so that the lid stays in it place the material is flimsy and cardboard is not strong the side latch or handle stitched is not the strong box can hold the weight when its full cheap price cheap value appears to be very weak may get damaged with in few days of usage hence returned it too early to question its durability however it looks sturdy it is bit different from the product image as you can see in my pictures the entire top isnt designed as projected thats bummer good for small families only good product,neutral
not perfect fit for long usage one problem you may face if you use it continuously for long time may be ear ache can be start although it an hp product there nothing to write home about this headphone it does what it is promised and there value for money as you can trust the brand but don expect anything extra no volume control or on off button comfortable to wear but not designed for comfort clear sound and mic but no advanced features for either yet it good for the price product would not meet my expectation and sound quality is poor sound quality is good cancels the background noise not bad deal build quality and sound quality was good base and noise cancelling is also good bought it in october month but now is not wprking properly,neutral
not quite durable and sturdy good nice product working well it really nice product,neutral

not sufficient power the product is more like toy for kids can use it as proper juicer power back up is very poor ok had to replace this product first time because it was leaking and now after replacement the new one has no battery backup and vibrates too much the mrp is above rupees which is not at all justfied by the product after buying the product found that with the product they are giving cashback offer of to rs if you give star review probably that why it has good ratings feel was fooled by the ratings waste product as the juicer is leaking which creates the whole place mess and the juicer doesn grind properly where the pieces of fruits remain ungrinded generally dont write reviews but was forced to write this one as this is just waste of money spend it wisely for something better it does not work properly at all after charging for hours the battery last only sec very bad product and they have given cashback coupon to attract good rating misleading information is given on the detail page bought this mostly for milk shake and it does an amazing job and it is affordable but it didn worked while charging user friendly blender very useful for the pg accommodaters am using this to make protein shake from day one when was received from amazon,negative
not too good not too bad if you have the trust of amazon basics then go for it am writing this review after using it for months still as sturdy and durable as the new one nil used it for fortnight till now in my car for mobile charging works well not working with fast charger if you are planning to use with normal charger its pretty good product quality too its good using this cable since years and currently this cable is running perfectly without any problems if you want to buy best type cable then without thinking buy it does not support display only work to connect network and charging good and useful,positive

note if you select brand authorized tv installation then do not unbox the tv until mi representative arrives this ensures that if tv is damaged in transportation then you will get replacement easily if you didn choose installation then just shoot the video of unboxing by yourself to avoid any hassle in case replacement is needed amazon prime and netflix are not inbuilt but can be side loaded to use your set top box with android interface you need to buy mi ir cable and set it up or else directly connect the set up box via av or hdmi port to use it conventionally out of gb memory you only get around gb free to use check the image attached there are hundreds of review on this tv here as well as on youtube but none explains the tv potential completely and what its actual flaws are here quick fact for the user complaining about the less cost to benefits ratio guys if you buy android tv box alone which has processing capacity similar to this tv then it would alone cost you more than rupees here you get this tv with that android setup with various other feature under so just check once what options you have before complaining eventually bought this tv since was already using version for months and wanted smaller version for bedroom now after using this tv for over weeks am stating my detailed user experience its detailed huge review but do read it if you want to invest this much amount if you want to get quick overview of the device then read below else scroll down for detailed review firstly its budget friendly only smart tv under in the current market has most number of output port av hdmi usb has android out of the box along with inbuilt bluetooth has dual interface mi patchwall android tv mostly prefer android tv interface remote has bluetooth voice search with sleek profile has better processor compared to predecessor along with gb ram gb storage gb actual speaker output is low need ir cable for using set top box with android interface amazon prime netflix is not preloaded but can be side loaded native display is only hd though even videos from youtube works well check images attached can install play tons of high quality games like rr etc check images attached finally smartphone mirroring works fine most of the time full detailed review built quality has combination of plastic and aluminium for the main body its not great but above average table top stands looks bit flimsy but are workable the screws which are provided in the box does not fits the tv perfectly so bought new from local store it has averagely slim profile not the slimmest in the market speaker placement is inconvenient since they are placed at the bottom so when you keep it on table top the sound tends to dampen and bulge has good ventilation for electronics and it hardly heats up overall built quality is above average display quality it has very thin bezels which looks great video resolution is but videos works fine on it videos on youtube runs smoothly as well viewing angle are good compared to price check the images attached contrast is above average brightness is good and colours are quite vivid display quality is also above average not very great remote control its very sleek and compact has only buttons and is easy to operate fortunately it has volume buttons which is handy have couple of android tv boxes without volume button on remote so know the pain of using mouse to adjust the volume placement of voice search button is improper its just below power button and end up pressing power button lot finally its bluetooth so no need to point it towards tv for operation other features it has dual interface patchwall and android tv has tons of content many games can be installed till you have memory left including multiplayer games google voice search is very useful if you don want to use keyboard processing speed is fast and haven detected any lags yet lags in streaming can be due to slow internet speed not due to hardware bluetooth and wifi connectivity works perfectly cons speaker output though rated is not upto the mark my jbl speakers has better and louder sound placement of speaker is inconvenient as in table top position speakers face the table and sound dampens internal memory is very less no netflix and amazon prime pre loaded though you can side load them miracast not supported even normal smartphone mirroring lags sometimes native resolution is just hd though the videos works on usb on youtube screen is slightly reflective its similar to almost all the other led tv mixed experiences of after sales service customer care firstly the installation is joke my installation was scheduled days after my product delivery and the fun part is there only days replacement window for this product company only takes replacement if the product is opened by their representative so there no point of return window time frame mi has mixed reviews for repairs and services though have not encountered any problem with any mi tv yet have had issues with other mi products and service center near me is always very helpful verdict considering all the facts if you are fine with above average display quality want smart tv and if you have tight budget then this the tv you should certainly go for trust me you won get any better deal than this least for coming couple of months if you have higher budget then certainly explore brands like sony samsung etc this is not perfect smart tv but for the given price and years of warranty its no brainer to choose this its certainly worth the investment this television is definitely perfect balance between price and performance especially during flash sale at an exceptional price of performance the processor in this smart tv is powerful enough to play bit hevc videos right out of the box vlc or mx player can be installed for enhanced media support picture quality many people complain about the overbright screen but it can be compensated by adjusting the display settings these are my preferred settings backlight to during night even the lowest value of is bright enough and can watch content without hurting eyes during day time adjust it as per your requirement depending on your ambient lighting conditions maximum of would be enough setting backlight to minimum improves black levels reduces power consumption increases led life and reduces eye strain especially during night brightness brightness setting controls black level increasing brightness reduces black levels and hence reduces contrast brightness at pictures looks washed out with poor blacks and color saturation at black looks deep but lots of details at dark areas are lost while watching movies is an optimal setting to my eyes with good blacks and not so lack of details contrast to contrast setting controls white level contrast can be set anywhere between and increasing contrast too much may cause highlight areas in picture like bright skies or shiny objects might look overexposed as the screen itself is very bright increasing contrast further makes whites look over bright also colors gets washed out while increasing contrast saturation to color saturation can be set anywhere between to at colors look more natural at colors looks bit punchy but still its personal preference at the above settings the black levels and colors were pleasing while watching demo videos of oled tvs on you tube at the following youtube videos help you to check the black level quality of the tv lg oled beauty of black demo lg oled eclipse demo lg hd demo art nouveau full hd and videos looks sharp in this tv downloaded sample hevc video named life untouched and also hevc sample of the movie elysium both of them played smoothly on the tv with very good details screen quality think this is va panel the quality of which sits right in between tn and ips panels the screen is glossy and hence reflective this might be problem if the tv is placed in room with windows facing it like all other lcd panels this also has also got uneven screen uniformity but that only noticed in plain dark grey backgrounds while watching movies or other content it not at all problem screen non uniformity is common issue even with high end tvs of big brands like lg samsung etc luckily there no backlight bleeding in the unit received viewing angles are average with some loss of contrast even at low angles but that common va panel characteristic ips panels with good viewing angles can be expected at this price point all lcd panel technologies have their strengths and weaknesses ips panels have good viewing angles but has poor black levels va panels excels in black depth despite it average viewing angles and this tv has got very impressive black levels sound quality bass is bit weak think bass is improved following some updates so giving stars from it very loud even at low volume midrange and treble are very good even minute high pitched click and tick sounds in movies can be heard very clearly edit in previous review have mentioned these eq settings sounds good but it isn hz hz hz hz hz high value of for hz actually make the sound muddy and muffled the following settings sounds much better and here the reason hz bass frequency setting for deep bass male vocals and instruments like kick drum toms snare etc hz low midrange enhances bass and depth of male vocals increasing hz too much makes sounds muddy and muffled reducing clarity of high frequency sounds hz midrange imparts metallic tone increasing makes sound tinny and unpleasant hz upper midrange vocals especially female sounds best at this frequency value of enhances vocal quality increasing too much makes vocals harsh hz treble adds crispiness and sparkle to vocals and instruments enhances tinkling sounds of metallic instruments human ear is sensitive to midrange and upper midrange frequencies here it and hz setting these values too high can cause listening fatigue even increasing hz is disturbing great sound performance especially bass is not even expected from television in this budget but considering its midrange frequency clear treble and loudness it deserves stars remote control minimalism is great but minimalism with less functionality is not so great addition of mute tv settings and video input selection buttons would ve made the remote more functional app support update when the tv was released there was no support for netflix and amazon prime but now with pie update it supports both netflix and amazon prime now the tv deserves stars for app support pros and cons pros powerful processor for media playback app installation via usb built in chromecast bluetooth remote voice command cons update previously the main issues with the tv were the lack of autoplay function and standby option but in the latest update both these issues are solved now when the tv is turned on it will automatically go to the previous input source to enable it go to settngs inputs enable stay on the previous source option screen off feature is also added in the new update long pressing power button will show screen off option the only disadvantage left on the tv was lack of miracast but on latest update build pi miracast is included and now its perfect to sum up overall considering the picture quality powerful hardware and the price the tv definitely deserve stars devoid of it average audio quality and the glossy screen because there are no other tvs in market with such features at this price point also xiaomi now has got very strong service support across india new brands like ffalcon blaupunkt thomson etc might provide better options at competitive price but when it comes to service centres it dead end am very much satisfied with the purchase it good product good if you like best tv on your budget ll recommend you this stunning picture quality and dts surround is osm but there was few lagging problem and miracast is not good build quality good sound and bass excellent product is very good sound quality is crisp worth buying brought it years back still working fine good quality,positive
note its ready to go mic which doesn need any sound card and can be plugged and used directly even with smartphones has mm jack connector built in you can use connector if needed it has very long cable which measures upto feet so note that it has absolutely no noise isolation and normal smartphone earphones does better job of noise reduction compared to them in stock condition but with simple editing this mic works just fine check the review below for detailed settings there are literally thousands of review on this product but none explained the best possible settings for it when used with smartphone with audacity software or even in general so took the risk of ordering it and it turned out to be nightmare right out of the box as the sound output was worse than my smartphone earphones so went to search for best settings on amazon other sources but in vain fortunately myself in experiments found the solution and now its working just fine first am mentioning all the pros and cons considering the settings that found and then listing those settings pros built quality of the complete mic and cable is good for the price given length of cable is insane feet personally didn find it useful as use it with my smartphone which is just couple of feet below in my pockets but for some users it can be very useful if using in rig setup with camera has universal mm jack which is handy its easy to use just plug and play device which doesn need any sound card or external device to work has support for multiple device right from smartphones to dslrs and computers it comes with carry pouch which is very handy since its mess with such long cables cons biggest con is the sound quality right out of the box its just garbage quality and even normal ears can bear the background noise collection so forget about audiophiles my normal smartphone earphones record much better sound quality compared to this length of cable is way too much for me and guess for many users think there should have being multiple option on length to choose from as keeping feet cable wrapped and hanging or in pocket while recording is not comfortable it comes with button cell for recording sound for devices other than smartphone and there no way to know whether the battery is dead or what its charging level only way to check is by plugging it to digital recorder or computer and test so if you are carrying it with recorder which doesn has playback feature or if you are in hurry and in case of dead battery to record all the sound then only way to find that your efforts are in vain will be when you comfortably sit to edit it and trust me its very frustrating am mentioning it as this scenario have happened with me once hence am very cautious about batteries now use it with smartphones or digital recorders think price should have being couple of hundred bucks less considering the sound quality best setting using audacity software these are the settings when you record with smartphone or any other device and there are lots of background noises and you use audacity software which is free open the software and open the audio file you recorded with this mic select entire audio clip and open effects and then distortion start the playback of audio clip in the software so you can listen to change in effects that you are about to make now select distortion type option on the top of box and select soft clipping or select hard limiter and do the settings as it sounds suitable to you take the clipping level cursor to extreme right end or so until you hear soft pleasant output adjust the make up gain cursor little bit if needed keep it on here you can select which ever type which you feel is suitable for you now just click apply now is noise reduction for that select short section of audio which does not have your voice but only has background noises that you don want open effects and then noise reduction click on get noise profile now select entire audio clip and again open effects and then noise reduction finally click on ok and that it now you are good to go with soft slightly lesser noises and more pleasant sound output after these steps you can amplify the sound from same software or any other end user software verdict personally am very disappointed with the sound quality though the audacity tweaking gets it to bearable level but its satisfactory enough plus price seems slightly more on this wouldn recommend these are someone looking good sound quality specially if you live in noisy environment buy this only if you live in very silent conditions it not great or best out there for beginners but good use budget mid range phone and the boya mic is better than in built mic of phone record it in wav format it good you gotta use software apps to pull the best of this like audacity or some other editing app it pretty long and that good as you can extend the cable to good distance say if connecting it to the camera on tripod overall it decent for beginners see high end phones have good recording capabilities but if you have budget phone then this one is deal microphone looks very well built it supports both phones and cameras there are some phones that does not support external mic please check before buying as one of my phone did not support it they claim noise cancellation however did not notice major difference it also captures great amount of noise only cancellation is because of foam padding around the microphone could not observe noise cancellation at least while recording on phone overall package is well bundled wire quality is decent however the dongle quality is excellent even the small clip to hold the microphone feels solid wire is to long but good if quality of wire is improve in future then stars from me but now star good sound low price star for wire quality but over all nice product think it good for online teaching like do but yeah some problems like very long cable length mean someone might need but it should be optional or detachable price of the mic itself is not much anyways am okay with this mic for sometime until am sure need quality rode mic to upgrade don expect noice cancellation under this budget but audio recording quality is very good nice product decent,positive

ok badhiya the attachments could have been bit longer this beater is less than half the price of regular branded ones but seems to do the job well not sure about heavy duty use but extremely handy for whisking eggs ice cream meringue or light cake batters this is the exact same beater that seems to be available under many names on this site with prices ranging between to as of dec so if buying pick the cheapest available price like did it doesn come with any warranty but took chance and seems to have paid off ko have been using it for months and still it works smoothly it very easy to use and clean and is effective go for it its one of the most convenient product and multiple use its durable and easy to use really like this product must buy it great product value for money go for it,positive
ok but quality not good thoda product small baki sb mst good did not get warranty card good for small family ok if you can afford it go for more well known brands in the mixer business this one is cheap quality but great for the price please note that there burning smell for quite few uses also if you grind for more than seconds it tends to trip then you have to let it cool down and push the red button at the base to restart it you can easily make dosa batter chutneys etc just soak the rice and urad dal overnight since it not very sturdy,positive

ok ok quick heat and auto cut average very good product easy to handle easy to clean can bill water as week as milk cord is little short steel quality is very good you can buy quality item think that the thin plastic lid may get broken someday you can open the lid single handedly and it isn easy to clean it due to its designer shape on the inside also think the base coating will also fade soon normally after few months of usage you can see the area of coil heating directly when water boils in my case can see that just few days after purchase overall wanted kettle with big lid so my major purpose was fulfilled it is just that find it of low quality than expected,positive

once you start using bagless vacuum cleaner you will never turn back using it on weekly basis since nov so its long tern review coming from another vacuum cleaner that had bags this one is truly hassle free cleaner at least you are away from the hassle of maintaining cleaning replacing bags which is truly mess and you would understand only if you have used cleaners with bags further devices with bags tend to get chocked now and then leading to less suction inside box vacuum cleaner unit flexible pipe with integrated retraceable brush and suction adjustment knob turbo brush nozzle multi clean nozzle high suction flat inlet nozzle telescopic extension pipe user manual warranty card the power cord is mtr and device comes with mechanish to retrace it back into the machine it has normal amp pin top which can easily fit in or pin sockets both amp or amp but better to connect it to amp ones only considering its power consumption observations pros device has high suction power and can be cleaned easily with bagless design where dust collects in chamber and you can empty it in the dustbinno hassles of cleaning and replacing bags components are high quality such as the telescopic extension is metallic though it also con for this attachment even plastic components are of good quality device easily moves around owing to its big and smooth wheels you don need to pull it by force default flexible pipe itself is long and has an integrated brush that can also be retracted its highly useful attachment considering it attached to primary flexible pipe and is easily available for use each attachment here is multipurpose when you open the package you feel like very few attachments are provided but when you start exploring you discover that all attachments are multipurpose details below attachments are easy snap fit and remove active lock in the company terminology once you insert the attachments it click locks and can be removed by press of button or release lever both the turbo brush and multi nozzle have flexible neck and wheels on the bottom for easy movement and effective cleaning dust collector can be opened with one press and has removable filters attached to it these filters can be washed once in while to prevent clogging the main unit has filter system to filter fine dust dust mites etc and is equivalent to hepa as per the company this filter is accessible from the backside for cleaning purposes device obviously makes sound but is not in the range of causing irritation to the ears it in the bearable range observations cons telescopic extension is metallic and heavy so it bit of trouble to use for longer durations especially when you are trying to clean ceilings reduction of suction power is via bypass valve built into the flexible pipe and has no way to reduce the power of the machine to reduce suction so effectively this valve makes cleaner suck in air from in between to reduce suction at the end but then consumes the same amount of power if there had been control mechanism to reduce power it would also save electricity device comes with amp top but its pin so if you are going to use it with modular power sockets with self closing mechanism for holes it will be trouble to plug it in everytime miss the blower system in this cleaner which is handy at times was there in my previous cleaner they could have easily implemented it for the cons reducing star but its definitely star device attachments flexbile pipe comes with an integrated brush and you can easily retract it back onto the pipe multipurpose nozzle has button to increase its suction power and with one press it goes nearer to the floor turbo brush nozzle sweeps the floor or mattress with rotating bristles along the length and if you want to turn off the rotation of the brush there is button to lock it main unit has system on the back and botton side to attach the multi clean and turbo brush nozzle primarily for easy sweep or for storage purposes final verdictthis bagless vacuum cleaner is hassle free device and requires very less maintenance but it comes at cost and if you are willing to stretch your budget it definitely worth it have had no any issues so far in the past year when using it regularly this is nice bag less vaccum cleaner with rotating brush that does great job of cleaning it also comes with good set of accessories found it also cheaper to order it online compared to the croma store two drawbacks not deal breaker found and hope philips addresses them were it comes with two pin ampere plug and you need to buy an adapter to use with normal ampere plugs in the house was afraid to use the adapter thinking that it may heat with the use but had no issues with heating of the adapter or the plugs in the wall during minutes of cleaning each room in the house do not see point in having that plug during the use one just pulls it along but it has no handle to lift the machine believe that one can use the handle of the dust canister to lift the machine but am afraid that repeated lifting like this will break the click on mechanism so ended up lifting the machine as whole all the time while moving the machine without the hose as mentioned earlier these are not deal breaker but enough to take one star off and can have the star back if philips addresses the issues on this great little machine suction power is good suitable for cleaning carpet window curtains floors and carpets cleaning the dust container is also very easy only concern have is if some length power cord is not pulled out from machine the power wire that still reamins inside the machine is getting heat from suction motor after using the machine for nearly hour and pulled out the cord that was in the machine it was actually liitle hot to touch not sure is it safe for the live power cord to warm up like this would have been even better if this had blower functionality also good product cord length and suction power is satisfactory good quality heavy noise this is the first vacuum cleaner purchase for me and can say that am happy customer bought this back in august and it is serving me well it comes with attachments that are convenient and reach high places it has three modes of cleaning tiled floors carpets and sofas and with pets in the house it has made my life that much easier thank you phillips for good product and thank you amazon for smooth transaction well built top notch quality suction power is too high,positive

ordered this phone based on specs it was providing later saw flood of negative reviews coming up on amazon which made me test few of things that was mentioned if it was true calls getting disconnected had call with my brother last night and we talked for min and call did not disconnect in the middle heating issue while in day to day use never faced heating issue but it gets little hot while charging can understand because of massive fast charging which is understandable every phone with fast charging heats little camera quality it has decent mp samsung camera module which is justified at price it comes you can judge the camera based on how well it performs indoor with artificial lighting conditions and this has done good attached pic of cake which clicked indoor only bright light source was candle it performed well can say to people who complaint about camera just cannot expect picture clarity of apple or samsung high end devices have to set my expectations right for the price we have paid an tu tu benchmark score while company claim of while tested got score of again cannot complaint here because don know what was the testing conditions and criteria that company had followed while testing is pretty decent score can say phone lag in two days of testing it has not lagged at all with multiple background apps running battery drain revisit few of the settings on your device like animation transition effect etc to get most out of your battery if your batter is set of monstor mode set it to normal or battery saver to make most again battery depends of usage of individual and cannot blame company while started to write this review my cell phone was at now it almost min typing till now it now showing have set my screen at full brightness fell its decent also tested charging speed to in min build quality it sturdy and decent plastic is used can say at this price point they should have provided glass build but again considering all price benefit you have got while buying this phone no complaint card discount exchange benefit etc still would take out star here black colour issue did not face any problem with screen leak or black colour it amoled screen black is highlight of amoled in case you were using ips fhd panel on your previous phone you will have trouble distinguishing have samsung as secondary device and see black similar on both bgmi played few rounds yesterday and did not face any frame drop or lag two year warranty they calaimed to provide two year warranty on this device but during registration it shows only year have personally wrote to iqoo team and amazon team seeking an answer with screenshots waiting for answer btw majority of phone manufacturers provide year warranty only even phone here would say fight for you justice and seek answer from iqoo or amazon team video call lag did not face any did multiple video calls yesterday with different people did not get any complaint from them about my video lag for all of them my video popped up instantaneous overall would say had great buy and can recommend this device to others for all the folks bombarding negative reviews would say first set your expectations right and you will be satisfied in case even still you are facing problem then you have every right to complaint and get justice overall give this device star as of now since am yet to test this device long term like months or months please excuse any typos or grammatical errors if any entire review was typed on my phone iqoo neo have been using budget phone realme since dynamic black gb gb it served me well but it was time for an upgrade was looking for midrange model this time that would have almost everything wanted within my budget did get one lets dig into it the good price after discounts got phone with practically all the features wanted iqoo is basically from vivo an internationally recognized brand hopefully dont have to worry about software updates for at least years iqoo is already doing good as have received security updates so far for the android that came out of the box will keep an eye on the security updates and os upgrades as it will make me decide whether to go for vivo iqoo for my next phone dual sim support which is futuristic with the call quality has been superb so far amoled hz nits peak pixels display with contrast ratio hz touch sampling rate and hdr netflix hdr supported huge upgrade from my previous phone the photos ott movies look too good easier to read contents like messages emails or documents mp main cam with ois ois was must have feature for me since could be taking lot of low light photos ah battery with flash charge technology in min in min works as claimed the battery life has been satisfactory sd cpu not one of the flagship processors today but highly capable and fantastic at this price inclusion of gb ram has made this phone buttery smooth one for running apps android is quite ram dependent os unlike os up to gb of phone storage can be used for extended ram currently have apps installed mostly productivity apps but no gaming apps the cascade cooling system seems to be working gb rom with ufs since phones nowadays tend to ditch dedicated micro sdxc slot and this phone is no exception did not want the gb variant fast large internal rom is better than an external card as the latter loads the apps files slower the in display fingerprint reader works well the stereo speakers are reasonably good infrared port ir blaster have not tried using it as remote but must try usb port with usb to usb data cable that connects to the phone charger some of us prefer usb to usb data cable instead as it is more friendly to the modern devices but can see why iqoo decided to provide usb to usb most laptops still come with usb ports even my recent hp laptop from the company work for does have usb port without power delivery and two usb ports my powerbanks dont have usb ports either screenshots lock screen virtual buttons must as using physical buttons frequently for these functions can potentially damage the buttons the bad google backup fail since did not have usb to usb cable had to choose the wi fi data transfer option from my old phone to this one although selected all the files google failed to transfer many files especially the pdfs dear google this is unacceptable spam handling my realme lets me block any sms want but this one does not in my opinion every modern phone must have native app that can identify the caller and help block number or an sms as needed have stopped using rd party app like truecaller which has become truly rogue app no mm jack plus when you don have bluetooth earphone or don prefer one but iqoo thankfully included usb to mm adapter in the box the absence of gorilla glass protection is not good thing but do not mind as barely drop my phone and the phone came with an already applied tempered glass screen protector and transparent back cover really appreciated the plastic body does not bother me moreover the dark nova color feels cool ymmv in my realme and not in my realme which means it is custom feature from realme for specific os versions if try turning off the daily wakeup alarm it gives me options like turn off on the next day for which the alarm is active do not repeat any more or cancel this is fabulous feature as it allows me to turn off the alarm for particular day say an upcoming leave or holiday without turning it off for the following days unfortunately this artificial intelligence is not available in my iqoo neo always buy recently released model if you are going for an android phone this will make sure that you get software support for long enough time moreover avoid buying the variant with lowest ram rom and fast charging is necessity as you see that you are hooked up with your phone all the time have used this phone for months and will update this review as keep using it till date am quite satisfied with iqoo neo also liked the funtouch os and recommend it to anybody who has needs like me,positive
ordered this product for charging cables the package involved packs containing spirals however they sent all the packs containing same colours the spirals are tight for thick cables but loose for apple charging cables as they very thin very useful product but the grip and the size of it was bit small for my cable as it couldn fully cover the entire part of it but nonetheless it gonna work and im glad have it as safety for my data cable good product good product if have single charger and its expensive too then should try this it really protect ur wires good good product value for money it nice but thoda length or ho sakti size thoda chota best product for usb and other cables,positive
ordered this product week ago on amazon but then got defective piece the case charger was faulty so contacted with customer care and they agreed to replace it after confirmation of faulty piece within days recieved my replacement pack and this time it charging well hopefully don have to edit this and it stays with me for long time good earbuds at low price bass is good sound is high no noise cancellation as described in the images only noise isolation is present used it for week without charging no charging issues build quality is plastic and can feel it ear buds tips aren comfortable for long listening but ok for upto hrs no highs no mids no lows but are stereo enabled one can expect bose or apple quality at of their price so finally justice done for the price paid if one don want to spend high one can expect better quality than this more often than not you find twbs that are expensive or don fit well or one has problem with sound quality but at this price point these buds are exceptional bought them for use at night just before sleeping they don come out of your ear making it comfortable to sleep with the sound quality is decent with no misses on mids and voice quality over calls is good pros overall sound quality is better than other brands bass is good go for it if you got for ears for some good listening the distinctions are good it is comfortable and fits on ear for casual hearing battery lasts long bearly use for hours day and charge once in week or days once cons not recommended for calls noise cancellation for calls is poor not comfortable for sporting activities mostly fits well but comparatively slips easily than the traditional designed ones touch controls are uneasy as the touch point is above the hearing point sabhi kuch accha hai lakin battery backup may kamjor hai kay bad bhaut jadi battery khatam hote hai baki sab kuch accha hai very good product till have used keep it up liked it but it was not up to my hopes as stopped working just after return window got closed feel it not worth spending inr this product is definitely the best in the market at this price range my expectation with this product was simple to offer good noise cancellation and up to mark battery backup which is delivered have used it for the last months except for few fluctuations while listening to music used it for calls and gaming and satisfied lastly if you are looking for the purpose of calling this device and all others fulfil the requirement but in my experience of using different kinds of products felt need for silent room for the purpose of calling highly recommend this product much better than the other high range products,positive

original rd jan this is my first smartwatch have bought couple of honor fitness bands earlier for family but this is my personal first have been keenly following the smartwatch space for the last months or so and aware of most of the products in the budget range while can afford slightly more expensive one gts gtr or honor gt pro oppo watch fitbit etc with calling feature wanted to get the feel of smartwatch in the budget range first gave lot of thought and finally bought this one as it included gps and amazon alexa yet to be included but must be available through an ota update have loved to buy amazfit bip pro as it has almost the same features with an lcd display has gps and alexa in the global version named amazfit pop pro it still isn released in india coming to the watch performance the typical features tried today first day are heart rate hr spo stress monitoring and gps have pulse oximeter from dr trust at home and so could compare the hr and spo the numbers on the watch aren very accurate to my surprise heart rate variation by bpm and spo percentage off by points at times but still feel it more to do with calibration and the way these numbers are measured than inaccuracy of the hardware etc gps was breeze as walked on the terrace of my rural town house it won surprise me if don get the same performance in metro city with lot of high rise apartments etc the compass worked fine when compared it with my phone music controls worked fine bluetooth data transfer or sync was good couldn control the phone camera as couldn get that feature to work refer to image and help me if you can didn face any issue with watch vibration during calls and app notifications the readability on the watch screen has been really good tried couple of workouts while the step count seems to be fine not sure of the accuracy of the stats on other workout modes to conclude wouldn say that this watch is disappointment but it needs improvements on the accuracy of the fitness stats probably should give it more time but fitness brands have done better in terms of accuracy at least the honor bands ve seen eagerly waiting for alexa update as curious what all it can do would love to update my review after using the watch for few more days let see update th jan the battery is clear disappointment as many other users pointed out hardly getting it for days with always on display and an occasional workout limited watch faces both on device and the app not many out of these do justice to the good display waterproof nature of the device is good didn dip it in water but it got wet when was bathing my kids and it seems to have waterproof coating which was in action got the camera shutter to work hope amazfit provides updates to fix battery drain and enable alexa notifications didn have an issue but could not clear individual items clear all worked review of amazfit gts mini smart watch model hello everyone since the new model of amazfit gts mini arrived am going to review the old model of it pros display inch amoled display really good look pros battery coming with ma from percent to percent it takes days to drain and it was expected to last day longer normal use but if you are light user it can last it for days pro ip rating ip water resistant which is cool pro heartbeat sensor it has heartbeat sensor and it is real but it may not show real accuracy at all the time but it performs good pro comfortness it is really comfortable wearing this watch and the band is silicone material pro work out modes there are nearly workout modes and tested out some since it is built in gps it works nearly accurate but the measure is not that much accurate but it works well pro can track stress has pai feature to progress your workout with better experience alexa assistant but need phone connection to activate this has other modes like breathing menstrual cycle tracking to do list inbuilt alarm pomodoro timer sleep tracker timer in built compass camera remote find the phone controlling music etc notification system you can get notifications call control system you can accept or reject calls but you cannot able to talk through watch cons build quality it is told that this watch is completly aluminium frame but it is quite disappointing that only half frame is gun metal aluminium and half is poly carbonate con watch faces the inbuilt watch faces are quite depressing at initial impressions but there are some watch faces that are really good con spo don know how much accurate it is but coming to technical part the sensors are failing most of the times sometimes cannot able to sync workout history con verdict it is not bad idea to spend money for this watch due to immense features and real sensors but you should compromise on sensors efficiency and build quality the incoming call notification disconnects if you re away from the watch even though other notifications are displayed in the watch have accidentally hit the display of the watch while walking in walls and steel doors even though it not damaged water resistance is good used to wash dishes wearing it no use of alexa think it good buy after months of usage all over amazfit gts mini new version is good but price is high and also calling features not available that is the biggest drawback apart for this other things are really nice sleep tracking is fantastic but there is some bug after the update is that the sleep traking track itself even we not wear the watch rather all thing are fantastic and battery life is day in normal uses,positive
over all good easy to use but do remember there is no existing button to set hard medium and soft boil its totally depend on how much you have fill water level like ml for hard boil it just different way to fool people to show up soft medium and hard boil facility good product and does the job as advertised autocut off is there but the power switch doesn turn off automatically it should be done manually which we can forget once cooled down this will turn on even water is not there so switching off is mandatory have kept smart plug with mins count down to overcome this issue overall it is good equipment to boil eggs but there should have been change in button it says automatic off but machine is not really off it will restart again when machine cools down because power button was kept on button should turned off automatically to avoid restart hence star less used three times so far boiled eggs each time and perfect results each time very happy with the product will provide long term review after couple months thanks amazon thanks borosil easy to use product eggs clocked perfectly follow the manual properly then it will be easy to use very user friendly products makes boiled eggs very quickly also the feature of making poached eggs is useful overall very good product,positive

overall nice poduct just one problem is that is the cord length only rest awesome easy to clean and easy to handle we used this for sandwich making and it performed well the plates for grill and waffle making are readily interchangeable the cord length is adequate although slightly longer cord would have been great the device is readily portable because of its size and weight overall very useful quality of product is good used couple of times and sandwitch came good wanted sandwich maker and refused to buy one from store since it was all and didn have half the features that was looking for saw this and love bell as an upcoming indian brand own an electrical sander too so didn think twice and got this don regret it one bit pros are the interchangeable plates for different ourposes grill one is just fantastic to hear all kinds of sandwiches and rolls and other food all the plates are easily removable and washable too only con that saw to this was the latch wasn properly latching while making heavily loaded sandwich in the sandwich maker otherwise it top of the range product in comparison with other big brands all the functionalities works pretty well only thing is it should have had auto switch off feature nevertheless it is very good product and worth the money sandwich also gets made fast ordered vguard removable plates sandwich maker but it came in faulty the plates eject button had an issue later ordered this one as was recommended by someone know it of good quality only that could have been somewhat lower price,positive
overall rating decent quality fairly accurate measurements common cup and spoon volumes covered all conveniently hooked onto ring from which they are easily detachable feedback quality could be improved finishing was very rough with edges not curved file smooth could provide graduations inside the cupsc could provide ml value on spoons big miss the tablespoon one is marked as teaspoon good product nice item good set easy to use quite sturdy very accurate just that the scoops are quite large overall due to the long handles hence difficult to store inside containers thats nice utensil to have in kitchen it gives right measure of everything when baking the material is made of plastic broken on first use quality was good and easy to use being low cost good,positive
overall replacement of original samsung remote its compatible easily with my samsung uhd tv but there is no voice command in the remote works well will comment on durability after using it for few months it uses two aa battery seems durable product quality of good but the channel button doesn work did return and replaced the same product but it th same result channel button doesn work good to go with this rather than purchasing original one from samsung we have an expensive samsung tv tv is great but original remote started draining battery and we had to put in new battery every days which was not ideal replacing with original remote is costly affair this is good cheap replacement has all the functionalities except voice which we rarely use everything works fine except number keys which is very important to change channels what waste of money had to buy another remote like the design,neutral

packing was not good over all good product scroll wheel is very small otherwise the product seems good at least at the first use bit disappointed with on off switch its too tiny otherwise product is nice gave star for the flimsy top cover and on off button rest all is good easy to navigate on off button at the bottom could have been better not the regular type of putting the battery at the bottom part pull the top cover and place the battery the slot is given for the wireless adapter adjacent to the battery compartment easy to use simple plug and play for better results switch off the mouse only during weekends draining of battery power to some extent is fine when compared to the clumsiness of the small on off button good to use,positive

peculiar product in the market good sound quality and build quality for this price range the wood color and texture will not be the same as in the picture writing this review after using it for more than month no problems yet so good budget wired headphone this product is very good for calling purpose no doubt about that made of woods definitely looks pretty love the design and the logo sound quality if you are music lover and would like to spend little more then would recommend sony realme boat but not this this sounds like toad am very disappointed about the music quality for this product is good in terms of sound voice clarity mid bass for music value for money recommended will try to post review months post usage there no bass but flat sound while listening to music also struggle keeping those earbuds fixed in my ears they are huge it is durable however suitable if one needs to use it for calling purposes only dislike great look and light weight quality and sound is good was using this for past four months its working good fits perfectly and light weight note please don expect high bass it average performance product,neutral

perfect for room heating noiseless silent instant heating within seconds easy to carry just small suggestion that it should have left and right wind blower also instead of only up and down best product not saying it in this range but have used others also this is the best till date even some time we use it as heat massager also as wind flow is awesome so sometime for back pain or knees it perfect product anyone of buying for the first time or buying for better experience will recommend to go for this its almost days of usage now and yes easy to clean also have dog and she also enjoys it got month old used heater not new one the fan is making too much noise it is defective or damaged piece got it on th dec when try to request replacement am told the return window is closed if amazon seller is sending month old used defective product should they at least not have the responsibility to at least get it replaced have been using ptc heaters for few years now and have been happy with their performance and longevity usha orpat so decided to buy one more this year saw this one had the highest rating bought it saw that its basically made by bajaj anyway its good looking and all seemed fine but started noticing flaw with the thermostat normally there is always hysteresis in the thermostat dial it turns on at one point and turns off little further back but this one was turning on and off at exactly the same point then started observing that if the thermostat was on it simply remained on if it was off it remained off tried it multiple times and realised that the thermostat doesnt work so finally returned it overall power consumption is as expected around kw at low and kw at high good very nice product good for room of small size upto sqft warms rooms within an hour and takes about for room of sqft its really light weight and silent in operation has different settings for fan speed and hot cold air the only drawback is that it wont work for big room or hall area overall good product,positive
perfect for winter meets all my requirement good but expensive product with working process since have tried bajaj fins oil heater this fin heater is not worth it the quality is good just for the looks however the fins are very thin and unable to produce the same heat with same power as bajaj although am comparing it with bajaj fins still the room size was ft and borosil heater really struggled to even put the room to comfortable temperature with bajaj it was done within half hour however borosil took even hrs and still we were feeling uncomfortable the fan placement is low and it doesn converts that much heat for faster heater even with max settings please check both physically if possible bajaj is on heavier side and fins are of good quality though received defective bajaj heater physical dent on body from cloudtail have again ordered the same hope this time it turns out to be good no company is providing the details of the oil quality used in their product good luck have used bajaj oil filled heater before this feels more sturdy think havells and borosil make the best quality oil filled heater in terms of sturdiness and finish although its simple assembly but still wanted to buy good brand as it draws lot of power and was concerned about safety it makes the room warm quickly based on the power mode you choose it will make the room dry have seen people using water vaporiser alongside but on low power havent felt too try in hours of use overall since it was borosil expected an even more beautiful look but since it works well am happy easily costlier than its peers using rd party off brand blowers for years finally took the leap and bought the fin volcano from borosil it has transformed the way with its reliability and efficiency packaging the item was secured and packed very well with amazon packaging along with the original borosil packaging assembly using the provided guidebook was easy to understand the unit comes as assembled but you have to attach the castor wheels which was pretty easy then all was left was to plug it in usage the heater warmed up the ftx ft room with relative ease it has power levels for the fan attached and temperature regulator the heater takes minutes to heat up and bring the room up to temperature looks the product looks very well and the black fin structure helps meld well with any decor you have in your room additionally the two year warranty and the safety features make it must buy product for winters would buy again did not give the expected result ordered this ofr month ago and have had used it since then it is powerful product to warm up the room pretty quickly although the first few minutes are slow but then it picks up the pace and evenly heats up the entire room it is quite and doesn even vibrate already own an otg and an egg boiler and now the ofr borosil has stood up to the mark providing good quality appliances at decent price tag,positive

posting this after days of continous usage came from oneplus that too because last to last week had an accident and my has dead on the spot after watching lot of reviews on youtube and amazon thought should give it chance first impression as you all know op has small display so it hard for first days to use typing because of big display little heavy but that could be because of upgraded species and battery from my last solid built but it if it metal build then it will be more beautiful space fusion color is looking killer flash charger works awsome but charger design can be improved display is crisp and clear but but in dark apps chrome brave linkdin etc you ll notice color change from black to greyish color that gives cheap feel and don know if it software or hardware issue actual review while gaming call of duty mobile has some lags and bugs and there is no option to block notification calls even after mute notification onn everything is coming on screen and it very frustrating and annoying battlefield mobile ground asphalt clash of clans battle royale are working flowless some apps like flipkart and airtel gives some error screen zoom automatically while opening might be because of android or something else now this is very weird that this phone reset few setting automatically themselves when don want that don want to set them everyday before using my phone am using bouncer to remove app permission when not in use and this phone remove accessibility setting even after batter optimization and background run while listing to music want paranomic sound but it reset to default automatically gesture are not working fine this can be fixed with future updates admit that funtouch os has some more customization then oxygen os but it is missing some basic customization feature like cannot change accent color shape size and the default one is looking very cheap must be because oneplus oxygen os is in my eyes but am not overcome from oxygen os oxygen os is lub funtouch os is very uncomfortable for me for the first days but now getting it little less feature in gaming mode in comparison to iqoo camera average as of now takes good picture in night evening time and selfie camera is awsome ois works good as per the budget and gives value for money day time picture are good but something it changes the saturation color by itself automatically no heat observed while gaming doing heavy task minimal heat that every phone has now days and it is outside so this is not big deal for me screen recorder and mic works awsome crisp clear display except the issue told above sot in one charge minutes charging time no bugs lags observed till date hz refresh rate made it monster some preinstalled bloatware can be uninstall but some has to be force stop only or you can use adb commande to remove permanently few apps are unnecessary like browser and screen virus scan comes just after install an app from play store that very annoying and somehow stopped that speaker volume is sufficient enoug loud in room conclusion in it worth for money with snapdragon processor and intelligent chip only thing that don like is funtoch os because it not gives premium flagship phone experince has some bugs as of now in gaming mode in few apps camera display that might fixed with future updates overall worth for money and yes you can pick it over oneplus rt like said you ll probably feel bad for week with it funtoch os but you ll be okay with it after sometime just because of oxygen os spending is not great idea think camera quality is good video stability is awesome processing and other functions are nice ui is not that good and battery life is not upto the mark pros super fast app experience due to snapdragon super fast charging good display but not comparable with super amoled of samsung other phone good large display size no heating in general use only seen when using camera video call but it cools down fast accessories given with the phone like fast charger usb to female adater thin screen guard and translucent back cover ok camera cons display is not super amoled or vivid like samsung or series phone battery drains fast avg front camera earth current can be felt when touching back camera while charging was skeptical about the phone would perform as sd has its own share of heating issues and all but for this is one of the best phones in the segment had pixel and nothing phone as other options although their camera and software might be better in some aspects the performance the camera and gaming features this phone offers is incredible also pixel and nothing phone dosent give charger in the box so it plus point the only issue faced is when switch the phone to hz it starts to act as it lowers to fps or something and the battery life is average it charge in the evening for sure but decent battery coupled with fast charger is more than enough use nova launcher with this and this solves the home screen style recommended to all good display good sound although sound is not much loud but have sweet bass smooth experience camera good but front video could be given fps good haptic every thing is good up to the mark but battery life could be better overall satisfied with the product they are ok can rate mobile is worth its money idont use fingerprint and camera are very good battery life ok,positive

products named aquasure delight the product is pleasant to look and comes with capacity of on paper but holds only liters of water equipped with reverse osmosis ultraviolet radiation lamp and manual adjustment for total dissolved solids can be manually adjusted only by service engineer the liter tank fills at about mins but the water wastage is very high for every litre water purified there is drainage of litre from the drain pipe please collect the water and reuse it for washing utensils or bathing shaving or watering plants the drained water is same as tank water just with higher tds the water taste varies according to the level of tds you choose very low tds will give good taste to water but at loss of the mineral content of water which will not recommend the default tds after purification is set somewhere between drinking water should have tds below manufacturer reviewrating the manufacturer of this product is eureka forbes am giving rate of because the product that is now installed at my home is replaced product because the first product that received was defective one the drain pipe would not stop draining water even when the tank was full asked the technician to check it and he said the valve is defective so received defective product out of the box ordered for replacement on amazon which they processed and got another one in which the led lights were displaced don know it happened during transport or it is some manufacturing defect would have been disappointed for the second time but observed it and reported to the technician who replaced the led lights to their original position so that the led indicators were now visible outside the replaced product valve is functional and now operating without any hassle service review don expect to have very comfortable installation experience its going to be heartache the reasons are the people eureka forbes has employed as technicians are thieves am saying this because aquasure delight comes with integrated diverter valve this is stainless steel structure that is fitted to water outlet coming from the wall so that it can act as converter to be joined to the aquaguard inlet as hadn opened the package when it arrived because some or many of the companies void the warranty of you open the box containing the product mostly electrical items that need installation like tv washing machines taking the precaution didn open the box so was unaware that diverter is included in the package the technician after fitting the diverter charged rs saying that he fitted that from his side and diverter is not included in the package came to know this when opened the package of the replaced product and found the diverter included along and confronted him but he defended saying some purifiers have diverter in them and some don still have to confirm this with eureka forbes the pre filter doesn come included in the package so the technicians sell it to you at higher prices my technician sold it to me at rs which is available at amazon at rs but then if had ordered it from amazon have to install it by myself don have drill etc so had to pay him rs so loss of rs on the technician my opinion on this is that eureka forbes should sell water purifiera with pre filter even though it raises the cost of the product by rs to rs platform review the platform in which bought is of course amazon am giving it rating of because received defective product the first time and amazon refused to replace it because installation request was not raised by amazon amazon never raises an installation request unlike flipkart which raises an installation request from its side which actually makes your life easy as in case if you receive defective product which you notice after installation flipkart directly consults with the technician and may even resend him to verify the authenticity of the problem for installation you have to call the eureka forbes toll free number and raise an installation request so amazon representative was demanding an installation report video or photo proof of the problem now how could make that thief of technician to write an installation report and about taking photo or video got the water purifier uninstalled as soon as found it defective to put it up for replacement but didn know replacement request has these many hassles as it was my first time replacing an electronic product summary product is good for the mentioned price aquasure comes with integrated diverter valve stainless steel device that is attached to your water outlet and the aquaguard don let your technician charge you for it the technician will overcharge you for pre filter be ready for that technicians are cunning and mostly thieves so be sharp around them make sure product is not defective if it is amazon is going to give you hard time replacing it amazon will not raise an installation request you have to raise it by yourself by calling eureka forbes customer care overall verdict if your family in members you have choice eureka forbes delight ro uv tds this product is very effective and efficient agua guard provides installation with in hours of delivery before the installation had tds level is and after the installation had tds level is nice product by aquaguard water taste is also sweet this is very good water purifier but see service guy for installation seems in hurry he just installed and went off he did not show how much is tds how to adjust it don buy this product on amazon buy it from local stores if possible purchased this product on heavy festival discount there was problem initially after installation due to defective water holding knob reported this issue and immediately replacement was arranged although had to wait for about two weeks the serviceman came and installed another piece since then it is working excellently in all the best part was that the services were good and responsive amazon part of the business was smooth delivery done within timelines payments exchange cashback all done hassle free eureka forbes another story for installation had to call them daily for days finally on escalation and on hold with eureka forbes customer service for close to minutes installation was done eureka forbes now calls me every other day to force this review my main reason for writing this review got the purifier installed and before that was having bislery water reason why have so many bottles which thankful came handy the deliver and installation was smooth after installation the agent mentioned to let the filter fill up completely and then throw away all the st batch of filtered water since it the st time filteration process so it will basically clense it overall so decided to let it full up and once it was full turned off the switch so no more whater comes in used the empty bislery bottles to fill up the st batch of filtered water which as shown in the image which is around as mentioned by the company after emptied the filter to its last drop turned on the filter with another set of empty bottles at the waste pipe side it took quite while to fill up the tank fully but as it did it filled up almost worth of bottles as seen in the image this is roughly or more than twice the amount of filtered water now the company claims water saved in comparison to other ro uv filters and have no knowledge of how much water wastage they do but think it bit much regardless fir every of purified water it wastes my tal water tds is filtered water tds is and the waste water tds is maybe it because of the tds levels due to which it wastes as much water ky does and it possible that the amount might vary for different tds levels at source but recommend to have the waste water collected and used for something else if possible rather than just letting it drain down almost everyday wasted is per month and this is considering you only filter of water per day ll redo this once more to see if there any difference in values this is juts to keep the potential buyers informed like speed to fill water less wastage like tds adjuster and easy to install dont like internal plastic body though believe its steel need confirmation overall good product we are satisfied having it installed from weeks deserve star on product however ran into problem when it comes to installation the technicians of the servicing centre at my local area gave me huge problem by delaying the installation at last one technician came forward,positive

product is good as of now the major issues faced was not able to get the technician from the brand later with the help of amazon got the technician to install it and the service was good product is good except for the outer material quality is bad very lame plastic service and installation is good water tastes good for copper initially will let you know after days one can purify water upto litre per hour only if your water has tds below my water supply borewell municipal supply the water tastes preety decent and light maybe due to extraction of minerals through multiple filtration better than the one water you get in the water supplier for rs coin if your water tds is above than the machine starts to malfunction by malfunction mean their will be weird thumping sound like some stone got stuck inside the water purifier the other problem you may find is less water purification maybe less than litte per hour and the water taste like cough syrup nice little bit of noise while running worst product,positive

product is very handy but the water capacity is too low disappointed with the product pricing considering its wattage and usage time you can iron more than clothes before water refill since the mouth area is not that much you ll need to move it so many times slowly on the whole cloth steam amount is fine but design is such that you can press it hardly on to the cloth during ironing so overall do keep in mind before buying that it only for emergency travel purpose for de wrinkling already ironed clothes good product does what it says though the water tank could have been bigger better to buy normal iron box takes lot of time and is not very easy to use you will need to use the conventional iron even after using this steamer for most of the clothes works only for the synthetic fabrics it better to stick to the conventional iron hiii the water tank is too small and can only use for one shirt or shirt so plz concentrate on this also absolutely good easy to handle and flexible movement it took me less than mins to iron kurti advice to users please follow the instructions carefully have some patience and it works great negative water chamber is very small and it takes full tank to iron shirt kurti the product is good unfortunately it came withou manual had to figure our where the water tank was and use it otherwise the product works well very low water storage is what put me off otherwise its just ok does the job but at times need to refill water even for single garment,neutral
product is very nice but it has bigger socket plug which is not easly available in all the corners it is not very suffocating can go for it however you should be knowing that it consumes lot of electricity you can buy it of you live in punjab as upto units are free hehe had it earlier and bought it again it helps to keep the place really warm very good product in winter for kids and much more all ecectric devices are prone to damages and faults but it should be possible to be repaired unfortunately this product doesn have that option and my purchase went for complete waste first things first it not bad heater and it provides plenty of warmth however the unit received had one major or rather fatal issue current was passing through its entire body be it the front grill or the area near the handle in the back you can hold it without getting an electric shock when it running if you have to turn the knob or simply move it from one position to another you would need to unplug it from the power source first otherwise it can be fatal if you use it in the night you have to keep it out of your reach otherwise if you wake up at night to drinking water or anything else you might accidentally touch it and die homes with children needs to be extra protective now am not sure whether this fault is only in my unit or general problem with these type of heaters have requested replacement let see how the replacement unit works ll update the review accordingly in my heater one rod is not working then call the bajaj customer care number it is given in pamphlet then person came from bajaj and my issue solved,neutral

productliramark webcam cover slide events datesorder date delivery date review date statusreceived and accepted ratings descriptionused terms in the description slider sliding part of webcam cover static frame static back frame of webcam cover screen frame the laptop screen frame the product is sturdy invisible for the mutual color theme for device and product and well manufactured if the device has the same matte black theme this webcam cover can easily be merged and becomes part of the device body as you can see my laptop has matte black screen frame and astonishingly the product has merged with it the little plastic container in the package will act as storage for the rest of the webcam covers it is ultra thin as described by the company with acquiring about millimeter thickness this thickness can cope with the windows laptops as they are having the rubber buffers on the top side of the screen frame because those buffers act as spacer between the screen and the lower up body keyboard of the laptop to avoid any harm to the screen this spacer is advantageous to the webcam cover as closing the lid will not harm the screen screen frame and laptop lower up body but still don put pressure on the location where the webcam cover is installed as the thickness of the webcam cover is slightly more in the micrometers than the rubber buffers of the laptop itself the sliding function is very smooth but be sure to push only the slider part and not the whole static part as it will make the grip weak over time of usage the device can be used with any phone and monitor as they have no issue with opening and closing the lids now for the mac laptop users it is not product for your laptop and never try this product for your mac laptops as the mac laptops have stunning plain glass screen that is covering the whole screen frame part and has no spacers that is there no space left after closing the laptop lid and hence upon installation of this product will damage crack break the plain glass screen installation is easy remove the blue tape and carefully stick the cover as sticker using the scale for support or else you could stick it little inclined after sticking rub your palm for heat generation and grab the screen frame from both palms and apply the ultra light pressure and hold the position up to good to minutes and there you go for your satisfied invisible life important even if not in use slide it times once week and clean it as per your device cleaning schedule to avoid jamming due to debris or dust overall it is good product for me it has worked awesome green signal from here thank you suggestionsto the manufacturer notice the static frame of the webcam cover and make its edges the edges close to the slider smooth rounding off or fillet so that upon sliding the slider with fat finger it can easily slide over the edges of the static frame hence do not put an unnecessary force on static frame to the seller well packaging to the consumer check for the rubber spacers buffers provided in the laptop like windows laptops if it is then you can use the webcam cover if not like mac laptops it not the product for you even for windows laptops after installing webcam cover try not to put pressure on the webcam cover location for long slide it times once week to avoid jamming disclaimerthe review and rating has ve been made upon personal usage experiment experience perspective for specific product acquired delivered usually don trust my webcam so thought of giving this product try it was delivered within days after placing the order received it on th june first impressions were really good always had fear that it would crack my screen when close my laptop lid after reading the reviews but it been months and there not even single crack in my screen build quality you will get webcams covers in the package it extremely thin so it won cause any issues when you close the laptop hp pavilion gaming used here but it might cause issues in the case of laptops with thin screens like mac book air asus tuf asus rog while closing the lid due to the pressure on the screen at the end it your choice adhesion am sorry to say that the adhesion of this product is quite weak it literally falls off after week of applying it had to throw of it as it became useless only had the last piece remaining solution for adhesion eventually was able to find solution for this problem remove the stock adhesion by gently applying isopropyl alcohol then apply strong adhesive glue used fevi kwick apply it only on the back edges of the webcam cover since it extremely thin used thin needle to apply super glue gently on it or else the superglue will spill out and make mess immediately you have to place it on the webcam of our laptop and then you re good to go its been months after using the super glue technique forget about about falling it has not even moved bit no effect on the quality of my webcam the cover won interfere when you are using your webcam in meetings and fully covers it when you want privacy overall its good product except for the fact that it has poor adhesion good product wish had known this before ordering luckily friend made me aware the very same day had applied it apple urges people not to close their mac book mac book air or mac book pro while such camera covers are applied because it can lead to cracks in the screen when closing your mac book it may also affect the ambience light sensor but that is the lesser issue as compared to potentially cracked screen and high repair costs mac books are designed in way that when closing no foreign object thicker than an average printer paper mm should ever be between the screen and the body of the laptop this item is inches thick that is mm six times the recommended thickness if you are going to use it on your mac book be sure to completely remove it before closing your laptop you can use it without worry on mac as it desktop and doesn get closed you can also use it with any normal laptop where the camera isn embedded inside the glass screen if you have laptop where the camera is embedded in the plastic frame around the screen it should be okay for disappointed mac book users like me there are two options one is you trust apple who are saying their camera is hardwired to the green camera light according to them one cannot work without the other so even if someone hacks your camera you will know it is on because the green light will be glowing if you re not sure about their reliability and you still want to cover your camera use piece of thin tape apple does advice against anything which could leave adhesive residue on their screen but frankly if you just clean it with some screen cleanser after removing don see how there could be an issue why am still giving this product stars it reached in good condition is easy to install and use and it will still be useful to people with other laptops or desktop screens with inbuilt camera it not bad product they just need to stop advertising it for mac books,positive
pros can use for preparing puree and small portion grindings less noise less space required easily portable compact in size cons the small jar started to crack bit dont know when it will break completely need to check if there is separate jars available takes time to grind both wet items as well as dry items the product working is well have face one issue immediately contact customer service that person was clear the problem within days happy to purchase the product it stopped working within uses but the cookwell company replace it with new one within days so star to cookwell services good product easy to use worth the money warranty was easy to claim as well good good product and glad for customer care support the product is working well it been more than half year now and had an issue with one of the blades that started leaking while in use but have contacted customer support and they were very helpful and offered me new blade all in all am happy with my purchase good one easy to use and if any machine problem service is also very good,positive
pros looking at the picture thought it would just be the blender with some cap to cover the blade turns out the cap was actually pretty nice container to blend small amounts of anything the container itself seems of great quality has measurements on the side and also comes with lid so that nothing splatters outside when you re using the blender there is also holder with some nails if you wanna mount the blender on wall the blender itself is amazing to hold looks great and is pretty easy to use the blender can even stand on its own if you have to leave it and attend to something else if you place it vertically you can leave it as it is cons after over seconds of continuous blending that is if not just pulsing it but continuously blending there is this smell of some sort that starts to come from the blender not sure if that sign of overheating or if it normal there this groove right above the blade and every time done washing there always little residue that was hiding in that groove which always comes out few seconds after done washing and always have to go back to clean that so that small inconvenience but it overall great and highly recommend getting this product good making the life easy great durability and original products very nice product for small or moderate usage good product very good very useful product in day to day work,positive
pros most affordable option year warranty cons no inlet and outlet pipes are given you can purchase that offline or found one pair on amazon for inr it doesnt come with any installation service or manual an installation from urban company will cost around taxes which is about inrhowever after product delivery lifelong sent me whats app message asking about installation they charge for technician and for pipes so the cost is better by lifelong support because within you get technician and the pipes hence choose to go with lifelong service am writing this review after using the product for months it is working amazingly the company doesn provide installation support you need to self install it at the end it is value for money go for it the company should provide technician for installation and conneting pipe should also be provided by company overall easy to set up look of the geyser are premium with well insulated cover product is good was using this item from years then again brought more for new bathroom very happy with this product fully satisfied with years working well worth buying worth for the money good product value for money but accessories missing good product in price range but power consumption is high if this is ok go ahead,positive
pros really like the stylus it works fine using it from last two months excellent for note taking tip quality is good doesn wearing off extra tips provided it provides all the functions which are mentioned charges quickly response time is really fast cons few times it automatically turned off while using but not big concern as it happens rarely not for professional sketching and drawing as it is clearly mentioned that it doesn support pressure features conclusion for price under think it is the best stylus am using it with pad air didn face any issues till now so don know how helpful customer care support is so the quality of packaging and product quality is pretty good ive seen it turn off in just seconds couple of times but thats all by the way ordered it for my old pad pro inch as dont want to buy new apple pencil at full price and somehow couldnt find the right alternative for st gen apple pencil either but found some questions here answering it works for after delivery found out it actually wont work and then magically the right model of stylus was on my amazon home screen when wanted to return this gonna order new one which kingone says works with lets see very good product build quality is aluminium so feels premium working is good as well best for note taking and basic operations budget friendly full recharge is completed in mins affordable price wish double tap gesture as at the apple pencil nd gen ease of use accurate all is good upto now and also looks good feels good feels premium product at this price deserves star good product while using it automatically off itself this happen when it is in use but worth buying than expensive apple pencil,positive
pros small size of the machine good machine in low price water pressure is good water pressure can be set in different modes inlet pipe comes with the length of the outlet pipe is sufficient the length of the electric wire is sufficient spray gun is very easy to use water filter also comes with inlet pipe the packaging of the machine comes very nicely in double box cons the sound of the machine is high the size of the shampoo bottle is small the length of the inlet pipe is short the trigger of the water spray gun has to be pushed continuously during use it would have been nice if there was device that could hold the trigger the quality of the connector for the inlet pipe supplied with the machine is not very good information in the manual is not enough liked the power it generates mindblowing power from this machine which just costs under used it just today noticed bit heat produced from the motor not sure if that is common other than heating liked everything that came out from this product must recommend for your hometo wash your car bike noise is low as compared to other ans easy setup very good machine and working super fine though the shampoo dispenser came broken in box easy to assemble use and good product at this price range noise level medium easy to assemble and use very useful easy to assemble performance is also good over all product performance is ok,positive
pros very sturdy and stable not easily knocked down by kids no fear of falling over mobile holder stand is very flexible easy degree rotation mobile holder also pretty tight very safe to keep the mobile the adjustable clamp is wide enough to suit any width you can fix it on very slim or thick surfaces holds well easy to assemble according to the instructions given on the website overall very satisfying cons bit tight when it comes to the gooseneck clamp so quick adjustments to length may not be possible while watching but that adds to the sturdiness so that okay the mobile holder also is bit tight to insert the phone and remove but again you needn fear about the mobile loosening and falling off for the price it is the best it hard but without hardness it cannot withhold weight of tablet so the the hardness makes sense not bad it okays very nice product bro value for money but you ask the store in this product how much other ways the quality and material are good better for streaming videos because if you fit your phone in this and then touch it then it moves due to the weight of phone or use this for any work where you dont have to touch your phone frequently such as video calling or voice calling etc otherwise its good very useful for students for their online study aslo useful for movie lovers using for kindle on bed quite sturdy and good clamp length of wire should have been slightly more by inches which will enable user to hold the mobile kindle at good distance the length is not great but the product is perfect for its prize and solves the purpos using it as bed arm works well enough it isnt really stable and tend to vibrate and shake when holding tablet and some heavier phones also can only hold phone horizontally that means it gonna block charging ports and speakers,positive
pros xiomi is best in budget nice picture quality very nice audio output full of feature cons sometimes tv lags sometimes stucks in this prize range all tv having cons like this overall nice tv the product in this price range is good but as it is running in android it lags hope after few updates the lags problem will be resolved useless product and useless quality display issues within months and service center is not upto the mark go for better brands where quality is assured would wish if there was option of negative stars uses as connectes tv the picture is very good was hopping best level of song globaly it is good product then ever good quality good,positive
purcahsed pieces supports fast charing good compatible with many devices braided cable protects from uneven bend so should last long liked the length of the wire the quality is good does it job now these days smartphone are so expensive and we are very careful about that but once our charging cable lost or broken we will think about the right one before purchasing was visit many local shop and also search many brands here but finally choose this one it really work good now almost month completely didn face any problem so am happy customer you can try the cable is very strong and the pins look durable good buy slightly pricy though value for money it is compatible for redmi note and supporting fast charging too this is must buy thing one should not think twice worth of buying good product,positive
purchase time price got this head phone got re use product in package st time but that speakerone side high sound to left side so replace that product nd time product box not good but product good after check there are no problem face now am use month this head phone this is good gaming pubg free fire battle field gta third per shooting game playing my experience good please check after buy one time replace then got this and remember offer time buy this product this product price up and down buy big billion day with usb connector this headphone is good but not good for base music headphones are nice and comfy sound is decent and loud however as it doesn have it own volume manager and only controls the systems volume have to keep the pc volume to and still have to reduce volumes individually on apps and browser so somewhat of an inconvenience for me as don listen to things in loud volumes mic works fine however it not exactly adjustable solid core surrounded by spring so you have to bend it but it slowly goes back to an extent and the movement is limited cable is covered by very thick coating and seems durable however it is not free from interference if your phone is near the cable you will hear the interference in the headphones the light on the mic is static and does not indicate the mute status can be turned off alongside with other rgb lights on the headphone you can hear some whine when some software is trying to access the mic and nothing is playing in the headphones is just awesome the software is very good comfort is just excellent not that good noise cancelling bought it for and in that price can get this type of product if have budget try to get boat im it will give better comfort and noise cancellation the product is nice for the price it has good features it is bit heavy tho the ears heat up easily and you can start sweating easily the product is as displayed and is really well built but the upper part is of metal which adds to it premium ness makes it heavy someone who only uses air pods or other tws will find it difficult to adjust the wire is long and braided and the controller works great too no need for any external drivers to use the control in mobile devices as well works absolutely fine with otg without compromising noise cancellation overall great deal for early review liked looks are great wire good sound good bass good treble good mic level is good interface acceptable can hear sound going from left to right when enemy running works on my mobile with otg good sound makes me happy disliked fake add that it there was no demo either how it becomes like there should be an audio file to demo or some sort of test to prove so actually it just more organized stereo headset but it ok for this price like many other know real will be dam expensive and can be sure how human ear will respond to that technique at this stage am still not convinced that is even possible in the headset anyway microphone isnt steady and irritates keeps on going below lip level must have been detachable atleast please dont search for light in mic as its not in the white model one gets confused upon watching videos people complain earpain but they don understand it isn heavy or tight but the deep loud bass causes earpain which they don adjust buy it great sound great base great quality felt llil bit heavy but thats okay best product in its range,positive
purchased from amazon for full price under no offers still beat competitors by rs order was placed on thursday late in the evening at pm was to be delivered on thursday but arrived early on monday at am quite satisfied with the delivery packaging condition of the item and also happy with the early arrival along with the vacuum we received basic instruction manual and warranty card the invoice was missing from the parcel so it had to be downloaded from amazon to register your warranty you require to scan the bar code on the invoice and whats app the details without any delay excitedly we got to assemble the unit which was fairly easy task took approximately minutes which guess is ok for the first time while getting familiar with all various attachments etc first impressions the vacuum itself looks sturdy built wise but some attachments could be little stronger especially the extension pipes could be stainless steel same as the drum and telescopic in feature operation the main vacuuming head attachment used for floor hard surfaces could also be stainless steel as it gets used the most and gets banged around quite bit would extend its life its pin plug instead of pin which could have been better with surge protector fuse the cord is of decent length quite impressed with the quality of the cord also the cord which has no autowind and cannot be inserted within the body of the unit after use can be rested on top of the drum in winding fashion it kinda works and does keep in place without being nuisance hose same solution the side latches are reasonably strong wheels are easy to install insert and work fine it would be absolutely fantastic if the various attachments could be stored latched to the main unit while not in use storage wise but can understand the limitations in this regard first demo was for the vacuum noise average not too loud or unbearable reasonable with any other domestic vacuum of similar power inside the lid the dust bag clings on to its inlet would be better if it could be secured locked with clip in vacuum suction mode the air gets forced out of the blower outlet this outlet is directed on the opposite side of the unit and is directed straight onto the floor level now imagine if you had not yet cleaned that part of the room and that dust gets thrown around or blown onto the already cleaned surfaces it would be an unending job like dog chasing its tail if this outlet had removable or having the ability to rotate something like flap or adjustable ac vents like in cars then it could direct the blown out air upwards while vacuuming the surfaces and this could have been of great design sense suction is at par with as described or claimed in the adverts nothing too exciting but definitely not disappointing does the job which is important then follows the demo for the blower this feature should technically be equally as strong as the vacuum because the force of the air sucked in while vacuuming is supposedly the same force leaving the blower outlet to make things interesting there are fish gill like vents on either sides of the lid these vents are the fixed kind cannot be closed or opened one of the vent very faintly can be felt taking in air while the other vent blows out air at significant force this particular phenomena am bewildered with cause as understand the escaping rate of air through this vent will weaken the force supposed to leave the blower outlet so make of it what you will still does the job if you re looking at blowing leaves or scaring the neighbours pet finally the demo for the wet performance is at par with as described or claimed in the adverts and as other customers have described in their video demonstrations again nothing too exciting but definitely not disappointing does the job which is important may need to dry mop even after using the wet function in closing definitely do purchase it use it often as required and also helps keeping fit do not allow dust to settle on your vacuum blower also ordered extra american micronic replacement dust bag for ami vcd wdx ami vcd wdxii rodak mm mattress and upholstery nozzle for vacuum cleaner wet and dry cleaning eu import it have the best suction power among the wet and dry vaccum cleaner even better than some of the dry vaccum cleaners bought this for my mother in law she likes it for being easy to use it simple and easy to connect and remove dust covers and pipes extension pipes are little loose though it easy to clean those cat hairs now and don have to worry about accidentally sucking the water from the floor because it wet and dry vaccum cleaner hope the customer care is good one incase of any needs arise they send me already opened package but not used think they could have send us fresh unopened perfectly sealed package no complaints untill now liked the reusable dust cover feature also it easy to connect it inside easy to handle don have too much weight it would have been better if there was an auto winding of power cables with switch this is domestic beast great suction only thing that should had been ther is speed control noise level is high but with such suction is ok as long as it cleans it all without ne to redo it again and again am ok rest how it will stay with time will be something to see it is very easy to clean as the suction power is great very powerful machine indeed have been looking for good vaccum cleaner for long time now recently came across this and read the reviews etc some were good and some were bad but at the same time couldn find any better specifications in any of the other vaccum cleaners in this price segment so finally bought it it came in big amazon box well packed and secured unboxed and it was as perfect as in the stock images here is the list for you to understand the pros and cons as easily as possible very good quality steel and plastic build the suction kpa is really really good even with the thick carpets etc the wheels are really good too they move effortlessly you get lot of accessories to clean different surfaces and they re good quality the blower function is really powerful the bag inside which collects the dust dirt is big and can be cleaned washed easily the noise level isn much its okay not loud the cord length is mtrs which is enough the overheating protection is good all the accessories can be stored at the given spaces on the base cons the only thing that think should be improved is the locking mechanism of the extension pipes they are good and fit well but if its carpet or some other mats you re cleaning you need to tighten it well otherwise it loosens and needs to be tightened again and again overall product which fits all your needs wet and dry cleaning of course better than any other vaccum cleaners in under price range go for it ve tried some other vaccum cleaners too which are in the and above range but this is the all in one op vaccum cleaner good suction with great built quality good durability good suction power and quality product vacuum cleaner is very fine suction power is quite good drying power is also just ok noise level is high as expected cost is high as compared to other brands overall rated it four star,positive
purchased liter and kw model for faster heating it takes about minutes to heat water from room temperature to its highest temperature setting faced one problem in this heater on very frist day of installation the green light indicator which indicates heating in progress stopped working on first day called the vguard technician and he said there is problem with voltage selector knob vguard should look in to quality control as other users have also reported this green light indicator problem giving one star less for this problem this water is working good otherwise the heating system worked perfectly however the digital display was faulty there was replacement option available when we bought it but when we opted for replacement the product was our of stock hence we had to return it using it from last month till now no problem working very fine easy to use quick heating overall nice product to consider in given price range same day installation provide by guard thru guard whatsapp contact because before the delivery booked for installation installtion price for steel inlet outlet pipe because this model didn provide inlet outlet overall my experiece is amazing with this gyser it take min for full heat my dial is set for degree but can use the hot water after min of heating look wise cool and simple recomended to all of you go for this product good good performance geyser nice,positive
purchased the cable for my galaxy note in july have been using it since and it works neat the cable is tough due to its braided nature overall good for usage not faced any quality issues point section is also good to fit properly in mobile you can go for it most expensive cable have ever purchased probably the best cable too giving star less for the premium pricing bought this as the long cables dont work well with android car this works very well go for it if you have to connect with android auto short review this eliminates need to wrap long cables around the handlebar when the phone is mounted on it for navigation compact and powerful best suited for motorcycle mobile mounts and powerbanks price bought at long review used to wrap long charging cables around the handle bar so that it won come in the way while turning after being fed up of wrapping cables to handlebars wanted something short just to sit there and charge device and clear the clutter on motorcycle handle this is just what wanted have mobile mount that looks like bobo gears jaw grip mount from local stores and that delivers tried few cables from local stores and they either die or doesn charge the device enough when it is in use even when the device is not in use the charging rate used to be low that is when have decided to give this one try as was always hesitant that for short cable is too high now am pretty happy with the purchase that it can fetch the complete charging capacity of the mobile charger and deliver it to the device did kms roundtrip and this has been saviour am yet to check if the claimed qc is true but at least it serves the purpose on my motorcycle handlebar so have no complaints will update when get chance to test that coming to the design and quality the braided cable looks rugged and the metal connectors feel solid as am going to use it only on the motorcycle am sure will put it through some abuse and can comment on the same when revisit this review for updates durability will have to use it more and update this review on the durability perspective as my first wayona dash charge cable used for oneplus died in months but thankfully it was replaced under warranty that shows how good the support is from wayona team only had to record that the cable died and doesn charge any more and they too that video as evidence to replace the product verdict if you are looking for short cable for mobiles on or for charging devices from powerbanks would definitely recommend this cable data transfer is quite fast and also compatible with my qc adapter good excellent worth for the money nice wire fast charge,positive
purchased the gb variant to sum it up in to pros and cons pros good design in terms of look of the phone and it build quality screen quality is good with little boosted colour tone the new processor is very smooth and responsive speaker quality is good without too much treble camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise camera in front is small so notch is not distracting while playing video cons main camera struggles after zoom and video call performance of front camera is inferior to stock selfie photo watt charger took hr mins to charge of the phone so charging speed is not time saving for this big battery good one under this price one of the best android phone by vivo its super good for normal usage camera is ok for normal it working fine and no issuew iqoo providing quality devices compared to other brands camera quality is not that high value for money phone is very handy and battery is also good quality of phone is good,positive
purchased this last month it good as working fine for me size is bit small but you can easily toast normal breads at one go just make sure you fill same amount of stuff in both sandwich so that both gets heat properly from both side cord is bit small but it good if you have plug near your kitchen at first use it smells like wire is burning but after next usage that smell will not appear cleaning of the product is bit difficult as you can wash directly under tap you need to use clean cloth with wetted with water you can use some liquid soap but make sure it gets cleaned with clean cloth apply some butter or ghee on both side of bread before making sandwiches else it will stick to your plates in grill overall good it is ok but does not look sturdy enough the top and lower heaters are not parallel if the sandwich is little thick little better design would have avoided this problem makes the breads go crunchy from soft would recommend very nice easy to use except there is no temperature control knob like my sandwich more crisper quality is good and easy to use received in hours product is good post review after months from purchase sufficient for to family member suggest go it easy to use and easy to clean not bad at all issues the hook is on one side so if your sandwich is bit bulky then the upper half may be tilted and loose on one side the hook is also flimsy so there is risk of breaking,positive

quality is good but received the damaged product was expecting the item but when the delivery got late had to understand unfortunately the product is of no good to me this item was glued at the edges good but fits loose at top bit tight at bottom but still can go with the purchase this fits the samsung smart tv remote perfectly all edges are covered too so if you do drop you remote from decent height it will not let the remote get scratched or cracked but you can expect it to save you from all kinds of drops believe needed it because my kid keeps dropping the remote and was worried because the samsung smart remote is quite expensive it even fits the slightly tilted shape of the remote quite perfectly product is good as described and fitted perfectly very smoothly thanks amazon good product in higher price side average ok ok quality fit can be better as side portions are loose and might reduce overall cover life as kids put finger and small items into it however the top and lower portions are tight enough to meet the purpose luminous blue gives decent glow when its in pitch dark,positive

quality is good strong build supports fast charging rates some people may find the led really bright especially in the dark and it cannot be turned off the port itself can be bit loose but it can be used with cases are bit thick just check if your smartphone has earphone jack beside the charging port in which case you might not be able to use both together happy with the product good good one more time teken nice worth it good quality good product thanks amazon,positive

quality of product is above average good quality product little bigger than expected please check the size before buying value for money but need to see it durability just got the item huge well at list didn think it be this big worth buying it its durable and looks great writing this review after years of using almost every day no tears or undoing of the stitching works as intended bought this mouse pad or years before and it really good had no issue while playing games you can consider this movie pad if you want best quality and size is also according to my need best product at this price,positive
quality of the material is not that good if it falls then it will break in parts easily but overall it is easy to use and speed of the ports is fast manufacturing quality is quite poor even small movement can cause the second device to get unplugged from the usb port which is not at all strong its cheap on multiple levels first ad foremost money wise and then most importantly quality wise used it for weeks and the casing came off and cant seem to click it back into place it works for the time being so im just waiting for it to die now but for rupees what else can we expect built in quality is not so good it very sensitive it is not tiny but small enough not to clutter my desk cord length of about to ft is nice usb ports work well the only negative point that is glaring is the poor finish however for the price good buy was damaged seems to be some one has used and returned this item,neutral
quality product but not very useful as far as ironing is concerned delivery was on time as mentioned by amazon so keep it up the product is kind of gift so not having much info or data in hand but whatever is shared put it on here the product is used twice so limited information at present the product is just ok it is not replacement to iron and cannot be considered so yes the steam is somewhat better than philips as the user has used philips also but as compared it should have been price competitive well yes it is able to remove crease from jeans and even shirt we prefer stiff shirts for office wear so no good for formals or casual shirts neither that good for pants the water filler should have been round shape being conical shape it does not give idea as to what level the water has been filled based on the water container it can steam to clothes at time also after to clothes the hand get pain so you cannot steam more garments also you need some kind of support at the back just hanging on the hanger is not enough the manufacturer should have given though on this and could have added an accessory either free of cost or at additional charge well so if get more information will update and change based on the same good not best like the product but the only drawback found is according to the water capacity tank in just about min of usage you have to refill so that way for each cloth you have to refill the tank it quite heavy so don recommend this for long use if you want to steam clothes than its fine also the cloth must not be hung up above your height other wise it will be painful for you to hold this heavy steamer above causing more pain my tip is that place the steamer on table after pressing on the steam button once the steam gets coming out you can hold your clothes swiftly move in front of the steam inches away that way you will save yourself from the pain of holding it also pls use plastic hanger never steam over metal surface is nice product but only reason gave star is that it becomes too heavy when it is held with water filled in the bottle it only days we used this product however it awsome and really great worker when it comes to ironing it effortless and very quick if you want to purchase steamer go for it it weights around gm without ml water so the only concern is weight and how long can hold it in your hand during steaming process otherwise performance wise this is by far the best machine available quality and finishing of the product are also very good certainly recommended,neutral

quality with low price it working good and satisfied good quality as well was surprised to see this when checked current rating in ampere app while charging it shows more current than what saw while using company original cable this is just awesome cable material looks really premium only thing is the connectors are bit rigid at both ends the fitting of the ports is acceptable some quality issues but overall ok charges less than the phone original data cable if you want good performance then you should spend rs rs and buy good one great for the price as compared to similar cables from comparable brands got it for good price during the sale period satisfied fast charging,positive

quite affordable but got few issues just got one usb connector that connects both mouse and keyboard what if someone wanted to use them separately mouse sleeps after long time and you have to press key in keyboard inorder to make the mouse active again amazing really really like it this keyboard or mouse using daily feel good and more interest at work to do bought this for daily use for my devices but since has only one receptor so it can only be used with either kvm or single machine at once also the battery hole on the keyboard will only accomodate lr aa batteries only and is not even suitable for the normal aa batteries so you will have to have differnet kind of batteries for both the mouse and the keyboard also there is always lag in the typing of the keyboard its not as efficient like if press keys pretty quickly one after the other so either it will pick only one key stroke or the second key stroke before the first one yes this combo is pretty good if you are going to have normal usage at home with just one pc in place then it is one of the most worth the money products but for all rest and regurous usage this will not satisfy the needs and you would need to go higher ranges of combo pros built quality design mouse design and accuracy cons seems small keyboard no num pad same as apple keyboard size if your budget under go for it smooth key press there should be switch button device is very good suitable for travelers like the size of the product and operation easy to fit in the laptop bag even carry for presentations outside to operate from distance,positive
quite firm and steady wish they used little metal or hard fiber for this like bobo company holders but great product at this price good product and good quality stud should be provided to fasten the rear screw everything is good but it suppose to have locking system bcoz anyone can remove easily at parking areas value for money quality is good wish there was proper instructions manual other than on the box but it not hard to figure out the product is amazing it is sturdy and steady even on bad roads the phone is completely safe buy this product without thinking twice loved the product so much that have to order one more because my family members need one too avarage quality,positive

really appreciate the build quality over all product quality is decent with only draw back that telecopic arm only extends less than cm which in my view is little less purchased and after one year of purchase my selfie stick working without any fault battery backup too good it is easy to connect and take photos and record you tube video best for recording video self recording with tripod stand it is so good easier to stand at any place for more check my you tube channel aamtech really like this stick and it blutooth remote light weight and easy to carry and have multiple options only problem with this stick is you can click vertical photos when in stand mode if the degree mode was available this would be best overall good but as the stability is not rock solid you have to be bit careful about placing the phone attached to this stand bahut he aachha selfie stick hai bluetooth se connect ho raha hai jo ke bahut he aachha hai or eesame stand ve diye hai jis se mobile ko ek jagaha par rakha kar bluetooth remote ke madata se photo le sakte hai go for it reasonable price and above average product,positive

really liked this router for smallish space the coverage never dropped and was mostly consistent however it suddenly developed some snag and stopped connecting to the internet apparently the ethernet port got damaged somehow tried calling tp link service center numbers and realised how bad their service is it the first time in my life that router has broken and that too after just over year usage and to make it worse there dismal after sales service tried to buy replacement from tp link but that router came with problems as the connection wasn stable think ll finally look towards other router makers and avoid tplink product until maybe they start caring more for their costumers hopefully ll find good maker good router after researching lot settled on tp link was looking for better range router this router really worth the price dual band guest wifi upgraded from tenda and performance is really good range for gz is not that good as gz but which is accepted and no other routers in this range can provide better than this was using tenda ac router since for mbps connection from local isp mach broadband mumbai most of devices mobiles laptops firestick at my home work on ghz except cctv camera range of tenda ac was good and used digisol ac repeater for farthest room of my bhk home in recent lightning strike in mumbai power adapter of tenda ac got burned out and performance issues creeped in with replacement adapter was searching for router with good range and speed within my budget tried routers mercusys ac mr tp archer ac before this both routers didn meet my expectation range and speed of these routers were poor than my earlier tenda ac amazon accepted returns without single question thumbs up to amazon after some more research zeroed on tp link archer as per comparison on tp link website both are identical routers after doing some more research on blogs and reviews found that archer is the latest model and had slightly better processor both from qualcomm hence purchased archer feature of onemesh is added advantage for adding onemesh repeaters in future separate wifi ssid with same strength on both ghz as unnamed wifi can be seen on wifi analyser as per tp link support page this is dedicated wifi link for onemesh repeaters now for router router is same as tenda ac for coverage it can not cover farthest room in bhk on ghz ghz band can cover bhk house but speed is around mbps on mbps plan however speed on archer is better that tenda ac getting mbps upload and download consistently on devices feet apart in ghz tp link archer is better than costlier ac routers just for info received us version of router instead of eu version mentioned on tp link india website hence firmware on tp link india website will not match with device firmware however this device has auto update option directly from internet also router can be managed by tp link tether app remotely on internet even tough not connected on same wifi by login using tp link account on both router and tether app by trying so many routers understood that ghz range will be week even with costliest router instead of using digisol ac repeater installed my old tenda ac in repeater mode for ghz ghz disabled now my complete home is covered by ghz signal in the farthest room receive download upload speed of around mbps also tried old tp link archer which had purchased when abroad performance is not good in terms of speed and range as it lacks gigabit ports beam forming mu mimo my isp has connected my link on gigabit port of their switch in my society however cabling is only pair cat which supports max mbps full duplex will try to get cabling changed to either pair cat or cat from isp and check the performance will update review after cabling change so in the nutshell would recommend to go for router with gigabit ports beam forming mu mimo even if your internet speed is less than mbps as it is future proof tp lnk archer is good router meeting all requirement within the budget hope this review is useful in search of good future proof router edit my isp tried to replace my connection to ftth and this router was connected to fiber onu using gigabit port it worked only for mins max speed was mbps isp was not able to resolve the ftth issue and changed cable to pair cat which supports gigabit transmission now net speed is around mbps my internet plan is mbps happy with the speed have asked isp to change my connection to ftth at last tenda ac is now working as wired repeater connected on gigabit port of archer using cat cable now complete home received stable wifi of mbps on ghz band will update once again when ftth connection is successful good product till now month am very satisfied am really satisfied with this product as earlier my phone is keep getting wifi disconnected and used to reconnect it and the same way vpn is keep getting reconnecting in my laptop hence my teams call used to disconnect during the meeting now am happy with this product where my vpn is not reconnecting even internet goes down and if any flatuations in the network as well finally am not seeing any issue with this router it is helping me during work from home please go ahead its easy to use easy to install more function to control the router,positive
really suprise there is no bluetooth calling and no gps although brand is good but if there is bluetooth and gps it will be extra good for buyers pleas add bluthooth calling so your watch selling will increase its premium build watch with mid range features it needs lot of software updates to fix bugs and bad design choices returned the watch after day use because the features didn warrant the price was paying for it the same notification appears twice in the watch notifications that have cleared from my phone dont go away from the watch and it even vibrates randomly showing the old notifications when want to clear notification have to swipe to the left for the delete icon to appear and then tap on the delete icon why the extra step why not just consider swiping left as removal of notifications calls on the watch only have the reject button there is no button to accept the call from the watch google fit sync doesnt work you can only store watch faces at time also the variety of watchfaces isn lot which is probably understandable because it just released with couple of software updates this would be really competitive watch hopefully they dont abandon it like they abandoned updating the one plus watch watch at price have used city bank credit card for availing discount the functions are super smooth although the health app sometimes does not track exercise overall the watch is great product plz update and add call receiving option,neutral
realme buds wireless design and specifications truly wireless earphones are becoming very popular and we could very well see realme get into that space in the coming months however for now the company has taken on wireless headphones in an affordable form neckband style earphones the headset has flexible neckband with metal modules at the ends short cables that lead to the earbuds and the plastic earbuds themselves we quite liked the yellow and black colour scheme of our review unit the design is simple and the build quality is decent the device is light at just and comfortable to wear and use for long hours at stretch like earlier realme earphones the realme buds wireless have magnets in each earbud while they don serve any purpose on the wired models beyond keeping the two earbuds together the magnetic clamp serves as the power switch for the realme buds wireless separating the buds turns the headset on while attaching them powers it down there is no power button so this is the only way to control power on the headset in theory this sounds good but the weak magnets meant that the earphones separated easily when placed in bag or pocket this would turn the earphones on and automatically connect with our paired smartphone even when we didn want it to which was bothersome calls would be automatically diverted away from the smartphone earpiece without us knowing the battery would run down and the phone wouldn automatically connect to other devices such as bluetooth car audio system what you do get in the sales package are three pairs of silicone ear tips ear wings that are pre attached to the earbuds and micro usb cable for charging the charging port is on the underside of the right module which also has the controls for playback calls and volume the realme buds wireless earphones are powered by mm drivers with bluetooth and support for the sbc and aac codecs the earphones have claimed battery life of hours on single charge and are said to offer minutes of listening time on minute charge when the battery is drained we were able to get around hours of use in our testing while full charge of the headset took little under hours to complete realme buds wireless performance the realme buds wireless bring refreshing change to the budget segment offering great combination of design and sound quality for the price also fans of electronic music will be happy to know that the realme buds wireless have been tuned with inputs from popular dj alan walker and the sound does come across as geared for this genre the wireless earphones with use aac bluetooth codecs we listened to streamed music from spotify and you tube music as well as our collection of high resolution tracks starting with take five by the dave brubeck quartet we immediately noticed that the soundstage was considerably wider and more detailed than what we re typically used to hearing from products in this price range some of the percussion instruments sounded crisp and well defined although the deeper elements in the middle of the track the double bass in particular was bit soft and not quite as distinct as we have liked still we found the sound to be detailed and rich on the whole next we listened to bit of indian pop with an unplugged rendition of amar arshi kala chasma apart from some gentle aggression in the low end we also quite liked the inoffensive nature of the mids and highs as demonstrated with the familiar vocals of the track the sound of the realme buds wireless is tuned for comfort and near universal appeal and sticks to that brief we heard just about as much detail and clarity as we could have hoped for from pair of wireless earphones that cost less than rs the realme buds wireless as hands free headset for voice calls and results were mixed in some cases we found that voices on the other end of the call were soft and our callers reported too much background noise crow cawing about feet away sounded as if it was coming from right next to us for the person on the other end on other occasions no issues were reported so call quality seems to be largely dependent on your surroundings and possibly the strength of your cellular signal verdict more expensive pairs of earphones such as the one plus bullets wireless and more stylish dual dynamic driver might offer much more by way of sound quality but the realme buds wireless does capable job for just rs this is product worth considering simply because it is everything you need for the price this headset is built well has decent battery life and is very comfortable to wear the only significant problem for us was the magnetic power switch which often led to the earphones automatically powering on at awkward times that aside the realme buds wireless is pair of earphones that does exactly what it supposed to no more and no less with unwavering consistency and we like it for that pros looks good light and comfortable detailed rich sound for the price cons magnetic power switch is troublesome inconsistent performance on voice calls ratings out of design comfort audio quality battery life value for money overall go and purchased first of all if you are electronic dance and hip hop genre kind of enthusiast than your search for good quality earphone still continues it not like these earphones are worthless for these genres and cannot be listened on these surely you can listen and enjoy it but you just could not get the vibes you get while listening those on deep base earphones from my music listening experience from years can tell you that the depth and that vibrating surround base effect is not in this it surely has some thumpy bass which is required for perfect balance in every genre but due to lack of that deep base you will definitely regret your purchase if you re hip hop edm lover the mid tones of music are little low in this earphone which also ruins little the experience of these genre song listening experience this wanna makes me think everytime is alan walker really tuned this for trap hard dance genre it good but not the best can tell you such differences because am also using wired earphone namely mi earphones pro rs which is excellent and produces very great sound for every genre and definitely have that deep base effect rather than for those genre song these earphones are really good for every other genres if you re fine with the above listed drawbacks then only head towards the detailed review upsides the material quality is good its plastic but feels like soft silicon layer is applied over its top layer both on the neckband as well as the wires of the earplugs these are extremely lightweight and doesn feels like extra load on your neck at all noise cancellation is really very good really impressed mic quality is also the best that can be offered in range no complaints the earplugs fit is good but advice you to remove those removable angular paddings for more snug fit and comfort is fine but could be more better as my wired one are really more comfortable and if you have also experienced something more comfortable than this then you can also complain about it comfort for long use the blutooth range is really good still works if rooms are in between the magnetic on off control is like cherry on cake and works like charm when you seperate them it takes seconds to connect with your phone if already paired before and if phones bt is on and if you attach them together they go to standby mode and goes off if not opened again within minutes it really good that you re getting this magneticfunction in this price sound can go really loud but prefer to use it on micro usb cable pair of extra eartips small large are provided in box medium is pre applied and is perfect nearly for everyone battery backup is good expect hours of continuos playback on volume charging speed is also good you can easily get hour of playback on minutes of charge and can fully charge it around minutes if fully empty did not get to experience its splash retention property downsides the outer cover of earphones are of plastic good quality but they would have given aluminium frame in this price the wires should also be given as braided one for rough and long use no realme branding permanent anywhere on the earphone confuses us but there tag attached on the neckband the cap on the charging port should have given to prevent dust from entering small carry case or pouch should have been given to make it travel friendly when connected to the device when there is an incoming call it doesn recites the number of caller and it sometimes doesn notifies at all but no major con is there sound quality the vocals are really amazing now definitely understand the lyrics of pop songs the lows and highs of the songs are really great but mids are little supressed and you would definitely miss that in edm and hip hop songs as that evary low details are not required in dance songs the mids highs are more important the base is adequate and keeps the song alive but not produces that well deep and surround base that youngster love but it definitely has that amount of base required in any song to feel it also younster and fine with it as ve bought it as secondary earphone for watching movies and series on tv silently without disturbing my family so this fulfills my purpose the beat and sound produced feels natural and clear like high quality headphones and in this respect alan walker and realme team had surely done great work based on types of music lovers would recommend this to pop indie pop acoustic rock and soft rock trap hard dance nearly all kinds of genres except edm and hip hop as ve bought it as secondary earphone so do not had any great expectations and can surely say that it exceeded my expectations and very happy with my purchase please read the whole review it will surely help you decide more clearly have good purchasing experience thakyou for reading best but little high price to month daily use he chal pata the base is so loud you can listen for long you will get ear pain after hour who like highhhhhhhhh base they can choose and sound quality ok quality is good best product good product,positive

recently purchased the kodak tv from amazon and overall my experience has been satisfactory the picture quality is good and the streaming capabilities are convenient the user interface is easy to navigate although it did take me little bit of time to get used to it however do have few issues with the tv the sound quality is not the best and have noticed some lag when switching between apps these issues do not significantly impact my viewing experience but they are worth mentioning despite these issues would still give the kodak tv stars out of it is decent tv for the price but there are certainly better options out there was offered an additional months of warranty if wrote review but am not particularly interested in extending the warranty at this time it is not appropriate or ethical to write false or misleading review in exchange for incentives such as an extended warranty or other perks doing so goes against amazon guidelines and can lead to consequences for both the customer and the company it is important to be honest and transparent in your reviews and to only write about your genuine experiences with product this helps other customers make informed decisions about their purchases and ensures that the review system remains fair and trustworthy if you are not satisfied with the kodak tv or do not feel comfortable giving it high rating it is perfectly okay to give it lower rating or to not write review at all it is always better to be honest and genuine in your reviews rather than attempting to manipulate the system for personal gain issues with chrome casting did not believe such good feature would be available at this price liked the feature of supporting the ethernet port and earphone jack kodak tv for the amount being charged this is acceptable tv the kodak xpro model is same as thomson series despite being big this was lighter than my previous bravia tv and easily mounted to the previous wall mount note the wall mount holes are plasticky and dont have any metal insert the remote sensor is separate module projecting from the underside of the tv and does not look integrated with the main body the two usb ports are side by side which dont interfere with each other the audio out port is good feature if one wants to watch tv without disturbing others when first connected the tv to my set top box over hdmi there was only picture and no sound the person at the service center whose number is listed on the tv warranty card said that they dont support this and need to call the tv manufacturer so much for printing service center number on warranty card this was fixed after changing the hdmi cec settings in the set top box not tv fault there is no user manual given with the tv most people based on their experience with phone should be able to ultimately figure out the connections the only included leaflet book whose pages were all stuck together talks about the android menu there is no info on the tv input jacks like what the hdmi arc stands for got multiple calls after the purchase to enquire about delivery and if needed installation as already had previous wall mount on which this could get attached with no hassles opted out of installation service all is welllll good tv picture quality is very good,positive

recieved damaged product the first time the seller is very good and quickly replaced it for new one go for bassheads if you are spending this much they are charging more for the metal enclosure and the braided cable the angled jack is plus but the sound quality is so so infinity zip and their own bassheads are way better for sound would like to start by saying not an audiophile therefore my review will be less about the audio quality of the product and more about the over all experience regarding the product first off this is my second time buying the product and you guessed it it good enough that will buy it third time if need be upon unboxing we are greeted by the presence of pair of extra ear buds there is also pair of ear fins in the packet containing the extra ear buds these ear fins are used to keep the ear buds snugly in your ears during strenuous periods of use where there is chance of lots of movement more on this later coming to the ear phones itself it among the very few ear phones that genuinely feels premium in hand it is very durable specially the plug part that connects to your phone many time my ear phones stop working because the plug part malfunctions and causes problems in the functioning of the ear phones this is not the case with these the wire itself is made of rubber silicon it feels good in hand and the only thing can think of that could be improved here is to braid the wire but so far the wire hasn showed any form of wear and tear common with most other ear phone wires another thing to emphasize is that the entire cable is flat through out this genuinely decreases the number of instances where find myself trying to untangle the wire this is truly one of the best features of this pair of earphones remember said something about the ear phones being made completely of metal well it continues to the mic and the left and right splitter both these pieces feel very premium because of the signature cold feeling of metal against skin don know about you but attention to small details like this always brings smiles to my face it is to be noted that the mic piece is universal single button type and hence cannot control volume personally this problem didn affect me much but the might be potential buyers who might find this to be deal breaker mic quality is subject to individual bias therefore can tell you my personal experience in my opinion feel that the quality is average it won blow anyone mind but it will deliver most of the time common complaint heard from most of my callers that they find it difficult to hear me when there is significant amount of back ground noise or wind rustling in to the mic these are common issues even with ear phones price significantly higher than the bo at bass heads finally the most important part of the review the sound quality of the ear phones as said earlier won be going into the technical details am bass lover and that is what led me to buy this pair in the first place in my opinion found that the bass is indeed good but not over powering for the average consumer like how the extra bass versions of the sony line up of earphones trend to be the volume gets sufficiently high and more often than not use it at less than half it total volume when listening to music the clarity of the bo at bass heads are above par and easily betters even ear phones in the inr price category this is one other reason why love this pair so much point to remember as the entire covering of the ear phones is made of metal it is significantly heavier than other ear phones this becomes double edged sword on the one hand the metal makes the ear phones feel very premium but it also makes it significantly heavier than other earphones made of plastic this causes it to easily fall out of your ears if the supplied fins are not used the find unlike the ones find in let say the newer bose ear phones aren as comfortable and can hurt your ears if used over prolonged time last but not the least there are multiple color variants of the bo at bass heads including red black and blue found myself opting for the black variant both the times this may be personal opinion but find it to be the best of the three that said do see most corporate consumers opting for the black as it is neutral color this leaves out the red for reasons unknown the red variant is sold at lower rate on most sites perhaps due to shortage in sales therefore if you are short on cash and just want great pair of ear phones then grab these while they last pros no metal build excellent wire quality and trendy durable above average sound quality cons metal build in the earphones trend to make them heavy and thus falls out of your ear easily supplied fins are uncomfortable to wear over prolonged time supplied clip piece is removable and tends to get lost easily hope everyone who read this found it useful and can make an educated decision to buy or not to buy the bass heads all suggestions are welcome thanking you dwarakesh best quality like boat earphone saund quality only disadvantage noticed was this can be use in usb phones mm jack is provided so it can be usedin jack phones only nice good used this headphone for travel very lite and easy to carry in pocket colourful sound quality is good the wire is thin so feel cautious while taking it from bag or pocket gd one only thing is covers sleeves comes out easily if not gd fit however additional covers sleeves are provided,positive
recieved the package today the product came intact upon opening the product saw some white powdery stuff all around the edges had to wipe it off and checked if all functions worked properly it seems easy to use and all functions worked good there are dedicated options for even deep frying which some brands don have will update the review after using it for while good quality good product good product good product works fine issue with delivery product bit damaged satisfied its timer functions is so easy,neutral

recvd product within dys while owing to rural area other product tks dys to deliver product recvd at gd condition works well aftr use if smthng cms up will review again it works good nice heating but hard to clean as it has ridges and small gap between the hot plate and the controls and also below the plate edges other than that fine product se jyada price nahi hona chahiye tha use karne mein bahut achha hai over all really disappointed by the product and especially cooking experience was used to normal gas and it was easy to regulate to propper temperature this product has only like temperature settings and it is either too hot or too cold and cannot be set in middle for example when set then it is burning toasts and onions when set one step lower it is and it is not enough for frying also you need to buy more expensive induction friendly cookware and even when invest to expensive tefal pan it heat mostly in the center and it is much colder on the edges you can see on pictures that watter boiling only in middle and toast being burnt in middle and raw outside the pan is very good and has induction area over whole bottom so sure the fault is in this philips stove you can see the pan from bottom that induction area is almost over whole bottom also due to fact that only center is hot then frying onions is taking much longer than on normal gas stove where heat is better distributed and even though you spent more time frying the onions the result is worse onion is little burned from outside and still not soft inside really disappointed by frying experience compared to gas stove there is one positive side and that is that heating is quick my pressure cooker star whistling quite quickly faster than on gas stove also you can set time for like minut and leave it which is quite convenient controll is easy but hate details first love one detail there is pause button which is very cool if something heats too quickly or you just need to quickly do something else you press pause button and there is no new heat it is much nicer compared to gas stove where you would need to turn off light up again and then find right flame again here you just press pause again and cook as before but that is only thing that love otherwise hate how it is designed first basiclly whole top row of buttons is useless those buttons are preset temperatures but anyway those temperatures are wrong or just for items you do not cook like there is stirr fry button and it set it totally burns onion set usually for beginning and then soon change for but even is too much burning but lower setting is only which is not frying at all would need like guess and it is impossible to set also noticed another issue that stove is sometimes making automatic pauses it heats and than probably when it thinks it is too hot then it stop completelly and in like seconds starts again so instead of consistentn temperatures it is doing on and off but back to controll except from fact that preset temperatures are useless when you want to change temperature it won let you or let you to do only one but not times why don know probably ill will you need to first press manual button which change temperature completely to and only then you can freely press and set your desired temperature so basically never use any preset mode and always only press manual and to set my temperature another control is setting time must say satting time is useful feature and love it but how it is implemented hate when you press time button then by default it set minutes ok but when you hold button it jumps so quickly that in one second it counts to and roll to hours holding increment decrement is so quick that it is useless it must have implement some idiot anyway you can always click one by one so to set minutes you must click time button and then click times minus button to set minutes it is doable but pretty annoying or long press it usially jumps directly to hours and then press times still anoying but save like clicks what is super idiotic is that when want to add minutes click time and it by default set minutes again arrrrggghhhhh so instead of just click time and times need to click times really this must have done some idiot another unpleasant thing is that if you need to change temperature you can not imagine something starts burning and you need to wait like seconds and not pressing and then after those seconds time setting mode is automatically left and it will let you change temperatures again when controlling stupidity is burning my food it makes me angry so over all would buy anything else next time maybe it will be worse but would at least try anyway to say something positive at the end like that product looks quite durable and material quality looks good packaging was also well but power cable is only like meters that might be too short but for me just enough also like mechanic buttons some stove has capacity buttons which is cool looking and totally flat but like to feel the press and the click buttons are under foil so there is no risk of something leaking into them cleaning is very easy cos it is almost flat cleaning experience is much better than cleaning gas stove product is good but service center problem not available nearly no ordered one was faulty,positive
regarding rate liked very much and reasonable regarding the product acer company is manufacturing computer monitor and are best in quality so that prefer this company in buying tv its been and half month using this product and have no complaint regarding the product some of its plus points are picture quality is good with clear sound quality we can easily connect any pan drive or otg to this tv and access your content in tv and points in which it need improvement its does not support some audio format that if we connect smartphone through otg to tv it doesn support the same also we always have to use tv remote to start the tv it doesn start automatically when we on the swith we have to press power button on remote each time to start this tv overall very good product picture quality is very good bought this tv on amazon sale value for money at this price the picture and sound quality was okay not that bad if you want to buy tv at an affordable price then go for this one nice good purchased this tv two days before and now it running observed the followings towards my experience value for money good design and finish great picture clarity am using jio fiber netflix sound also clear and smooth but little bit improvement needed package packed well as advertised remote batteries av wire warranty card manual promptly delivered damage refresh rate is hz overall recommended picture quality is good sound also good value for money one can purchase at low price,positive

review after using it for about month pros battery backup is the most amazing of all sound quality is amazing but bass is on the low side build quality is well made almost feels premium but could be improved very comfy even after long day use cons there noticable delay in touch controls most irritating one there no such thing as no delay during gaming on wireless earphones just get wired instead of this if you are planning on using it for gaming noise cancellation calling or enc doesnt work also while calling nd person most of the time says that can hear you well or your voice is so low on outdoors sometimes earphone doesn turns on so have to manually turn it on to pickup call one tap but here the catch to disconnect ongoing call have to double tap on the touch panel boat says single tap tho conclusion if you have little more budget don buy this else this just works fine recently purchased the bo at airdopes in ear true wireless earbuds and have been using them for the past week overall am satisfied with the product the earbuds are comfortable to wear and have good fit and the sound quality is impressive for the price point however was disappointed to discover that the earbuds do not have noise cancellation as advertised while they do block out some ambient noise they are not as effective as other earbuds ve used with noise cancellation technology the battery life has been satisfactory the earbuds last for good amount of time on single charge and the case is convenient for charging on the go overall would recommend the bo at airdopes earbuds for those looking for budget friendly option with good sound quality just be aware that they do not have noise cancellation am writing this review after two days of usage sound quality the lows are good and pleasing to the ears bass quality is good just felt like the treble is little too high which makes the high frequency music sound bit unpleasant overall the quality is okay but not as good as wired headset or neckband earphones kaam chal jayga battery backup it been days and haven charged it yet still showing of battery remaining so don think battery backup would be problem moderate usage built the case is small and handy it feels sturdy the buds fit well in the ears overall built is good latency this one for gamers am actually impressed by the low latency it has even without turning on the beast mode the feedback is almost instantaneous and after turning on the beast mode it becomes flawless played bgmi and cod and didn feel any lag in the sound calling tried calling in silent atmosphere and there was no problem faced will update you guys if there turns out to be problem when calling in crowded area in rupees it is good earphones good battary life good sound good connectivity cons very poor build quality feel so cheap if you choosy person then you don like the product if you re looking for wireless earphone under go for it this product is good the sound leakage is there no doubt but you won feel any sort of distortion the airdrops are very handy compact in size long lasting battery for its size and the connectivity is is pretty good along with the sound quality though it has room for improvement in noise cancellation but still performs very well for this price point its good product sound quality is also agood but noise cancellation is average it is good product but only for months,neutral
review overview average the boat today launched the boat xtend the companys latest budget smartwatch with price tag of rs the boat xtend smartwatch comes with stylish design resembling the apple watch moreover it has built in amazon alexa support sp tracking stress tracking and much more coming in budget segment is it worth it should you buy this smartwatch if you too have such queries then there is nothing to worry about it is detailed review of boat xtend smartwatch which will clear all your doubts about it contents box content design build comfort display watch ui and features alexa support watch faces boat wave app accuracy battery final words buy now box content boat xtend box content smartwatch in black gold colour charging clip user manual and warranty card design build comfort when buying smartwatch one always thinks about its design and look apart from features design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying smartwatch the boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to premium side in terms of look the design is inspired by the apple watch but it cannot be compared to that obviously in every aspect apple watch would be much better than the boat xtend smartwatch redmi watch as well as amazfit bip pro has the same shape and design but the build quality is much premium on this one boat xtend design and build personally dont like the color scheme of this boat xtend smartwatch the black color variant comes with golden color metallic frame believe the gold color would fade away after some time there are three other color variants which also dont look stylish as this one however that is my personal opinion on the color scheme so maybe you might find the color scheme to be good boat xtend design the watch has atm water resistance it has silicon straps which are quite comfortable the straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usage display coming to the display the watch has mm square shape display what you see on this one is tft panel the screen has big bezels however the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off so you wont notice the bezels and the screen quality wont feel cheap at all it doesnt have an always on display but we cannot complain about that the watch offers screen on time of up to seconds and up to levels of brightness control boat xtend display quality find the display quality of the boat xtend smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from boat view angle is good on this one and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight the color on this one is not very saturated but this isnt something that we can complain about in this price range watch ui and features the ui of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use there is single button on the watch which works as the power off button as well as the back button moreover the display is touchscreen display that works without any problem there isnt much animation on the bar menu and the navigation is simple so you wont find it difficult to use however the watch may lag bit the company has done cost cutting in terms of the processor thats why you may find it to lag bit but it is ok and not big deal at the price point you get it boat xtend ui the watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity which includes total steps walked calories burnt and time heart rate sleep tracking stress tracking breath training sp training meditation find my phone and music control apart from that there are different support modes on this watch tried few of them and they worked fine the watch notifies you of the incoming calls messages received and various other notifications in detail boat xtend smartwatch review alexa support the main highlight of the boat xtend is the amazon alexa support the watch has an in built microphone and you can access it by long pressing the back button do note that you can only do some basic tasks with alexa on the watch like setting an alarm setting timer and such well it is good thing to have alexa on watch but you wont find it very useful probably you will use it for day or two out of excitement and then you wont prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks so even if boat missed this feature it wont be problem boat xtend alexa support watch faces the next cool thing about this boat smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one you get more than watch faces on the watch and probably more watch faces will be added to it moreover you can also set custom watch face as well boat xtend watch faces boat wave app you will have to download the boat wave app to use the watch the app is available for both android as well as os devices you wont be seeing bugs on the app and it works perfectly havent noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection the interface of the boat wave is clean and simple you will get all the fitness related options and all the watch settings on the app itself boat xtend boat wave app accuracy accuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying smartwatch so talking about the accuracy tested everything on this watch from normal walking to running sleeping and much more and find the results to be accurate boat xtend accuracy test compared to realme or redmi watch the result was the same on all of them so there is no problem with the accuracy dont find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers but yes this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking sleep tracking and everything it does boat xtend accuracy comparing it to the noise watch which we tried recently the stress level as well as the sp tracking is much more accurate on this one it also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women boat xtend accuracy battery you get to see ah battery on this one which the company claims to last days however if you use most of the features of the watch then the battery will last about two and half days if you keep the brightness low then the battery will last about days find the battery life to be downside of the watch it comes with magnet hook charging support final words boat xtend smartwatch is decent smartwatch from the boat it offers all the basic fitness features you will find on budget fitness tracker good display alexa support good design and build and much more the smartwatch at this price is quite good personally what didnt like about this smartwatch is its color scheme however if you like the color scheme then would recommend you to go for it overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life the battery life on this one is quite low the company claims it to have battery life of days but with regular usage it will last for days if you are looking for good smartwatch under rs and you can adjust with the battery life and you like the color scheme then would recommend you to go for this smartwatch it offers all the features that should be there in smartwatch under rs pros premium build quality with matte finishing sturdy polycarbonate frame good soft silicone straps that absolutely flush with the body of the watch attractive trendy colours heart rate except heart rate spikes in weight training pedometer steps counter are accurate but spo is off by when compared to pulse oximeter readings but most smart watches offer the same accuracy sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time wake up time duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate light deep sleep waking detected but no rem sleep detected sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with boat wave app issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces large clear bright sharp lcd ips display even in the sun touch not smooth experienced jitters ui also lags at times after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require taps to work but acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically in app gps works superbly excellent route tracking on the map this feature is not advertised in their description bluetooth connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity the boat wave app must remain running in the background at all times definitely splash proof though did nt take the risk of submerging the watch all notifications are working no problem with call alerts or sms msgs or social media app notifications no lags at all though there is provision for sec lag which can be turned on alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker info is displayed on the screen my wipro smart bulb fire tv stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt alexa on the watch alexa can do mathematical calculations currency conversions even foreign language translations apart from supplying info on anything under the sun but ofcourse alexa cannot make calls alexa can set alarm timer also sedentary alert drinking water reminder stress alert menstrual cycle alert alarms timers function well boat wave app connects easily no lags observed data syncs smoothly with google fit app excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges but settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective training sports modes good guided breathing mode is also good find my phone works well extremely stylish light weight comfortable for all day wear watch faces available in the device with preset which cannot be deleted the rest can be changed from the boat wave app cons lacks vibration intensity control lacks camera control shutter but can figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands gestures to click pics no quick reply messages for notifications call alerts no call acceptance or silencing feature work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time spo is not accurate and sometimes freezes at but this is common in all smart watches battery does nt last more than days if continuous hr measurement is turned on otherwise easily lasts for days watch faces are very childish expected better quality designs company can easily improve on this in their next update amazon prime only replacement no refund policy is not good at least colour change should be allowed once music control feature does not display the title of the song no bp monitoring or temperature monitoring feature smart watches usually do not provide reliable bp data no calling feature but it does nt matter as most don want conversations to be public bit large for narrow wrists band mm is bit wide company should provide tempered glass protector no mention of protective glass on the display mentioned have attached scot tempered glass purchased separately there are actually only sports modes boat has bloated the list with indoor outdoor combi of sports walking running swimming cycling there is no light sensor auto brightness is only time dependant but works well was wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour the evergreen classic gold black overall the best smart watch with alexa built in available at the budget price point of under rs an excellent fitness tracker but average health monitor plz add calling feature with this otherwise it is ok good it little expensive but okkk,positive
review written on it is nice little tripod for your phone mini camera or gopro it has rubber grips which makes it anti slip on flat surfaces and feels sturdy in your hand here are few pros and cons should know before buying proslight weight and easy to assemble very good for small devices stability is superb comes with bluetooth remote quality of rubber and plastic is great conssize is quite small it looks little bigger in the images shown not at all suitable for big dslr cameras or video cameras think that the rotaion of the balls can become loose after several months of use ll update here final verdict for the price of it is good product as it is quite useful when you vlog or want to take group photos it will easily carry your mobile phones and small cameras but dont even think of mounting your professional camera on it it is very small compared to big cameras go for it it great product basicly purchased it to record timeplace video but when recieved it was surprised because it was soo good at less and affordable price but gave it stars because of the bluetooth remote as it was unable to click photos and even changed the battery but it didnot worked product is very good as compare to the price personal opinion little bit quality of the material with bit more size could have been improved good but could be more better can take mobile weight need to adjust stand every time for single click this tripod is good purchase pretty standard quality must say bluetooth remote also works perfectly not very suitable for hefty dslr cameras good for mobile phones and vlogging use this product from year no complain learning needed,neutral
reviewing just after day of using this product we made french fries and chicken tikka and result is quiet impressive the recipe book and cooking tips from the given qr code is really helpful hope it serves for long time not to forget about the beautiful bottle green and golden look of it detailed user manual no idea about the cooking time how to use is not describe it works well and plastic quality is poor but it can wothstand the temperature for sure its not toy to look for high quality plastic and for the half the price that the other models we can ignore that functionality wise its perfect just buy it don go for costly products as it is available in reasonable price and it has so many great features happy with it pigeon never dissapointd with their quality the best way to have healthy crispy food the outcome of cooked is not up to the mark the recipe book was not attached so it is difficult to know how to cook different dishes tried some but outcome was bad definitely you will have to compromise taste if you use this appliance very much worried about the current consumption think before you buy these air fryers,positive

samsung offers super fast charging at watt just joke wherever other brands are offering full charge before an hour providing heavy chargers samsung is not secondly samsung is offering to charging you need to carry your charger always you can not charge your phone with some other type cable thirdly this device responds only with its own charger you can charge it with other type charger good enough if you want to get some juice in short time samsung could include the cable samsung should provide charger with their box super fast charging quickly charged my mobile baught this adapter for my new google pixel but it was not packed received the adapter in open and broken box checked the adapter quality serial number and matched with the box so it is genuine performance is good but its very huge almost triple to conventional charger difficult during trips but charging wise no issues at all great but little hot the mobile this adapter has type socket which is like the charging cable socket in our mobile so you need to buy type type charging wire,positive

seller cloudtail india private limited price price can drop as low as delivery one day prime bangalore package big carton box with air pack no damage recommended yes returnable yesroom heaters which one do you need before my review will let you know which one should you buy an oil heater is best that you can buy but that is worth spending for places where the weather will be colder for more than months and well below deg for normal winter uses recommend buying convection type heaters with fan and thermostat please avoid conduction based ones they can consume less power cheap but they are very slow plus burns oxygen also note whichever you buy make sure it has thermostat setting product review this product from usha is convection type room heater and have listed the below features and information twin blade fan thermostat built in like ac will turn on off as per temp changes operation means faster heating fan only mode for normal table fan type can adjust speed on off power led when it operates fan noise is high and bit annoying if your room is very calm power plug and cord length retracting stand to elevate height about inches year warranty for the product the room heater uses powerful fan to spread the heat no swing option very directional you must position it correctly and securely the thermostat option is good to have and suggest buyers to buy with thermostat as this will help reduce your eb bills as well as give comfortable weather inside the thermostat is not very accurate like in air conditioners but works the user manual gives clear information about using it how to set up power on select the switch is not easy to operate set to thermostat switch to max anti clockwise let the heater run till you feel comfortable warm inside reduce the thermostat slowly till the point where the unit turns off leave that setting undisturbed and let the heater on till morning note if you have mistakenly set it wrongly turn off and turn on once again follow the same step above use this for my sleeping room which is about size in bangalore it is about deg at night and can drop low in another few weeks and it took about minutes to bring it deg with in almost closed room please note if your place has room temperature not outside temp well below and it not exposed to sunlight then it will take long time to reach comfortable temperature in such cases only use setting it does not burn oxygen but reduces relative humidity which can cause dryness so keeping bucket or better tray of water will help but you must keep your window slightly open never use it on closed room or see this as main problem as in many of our houses we only have for washing machines and ac socket which is not easily reachable this unit can only be plugged into socket the reason is when you operate unit with socket you can only draw maximum of watts from that socket however since this unit operates also at it requires as that could only provide up to like acs etc however you can safely use this unit from normal socket only if you are using at always just buy to converter socket and use this do not worry it will work just fine but never use though if you house has mcb tripper then it much safe tips always keep some space from all sides of the heater unit first try with fan unit for minutes before using for heater using after long storage keep window slightly open for fresh air air can feel dry after sometime can cause nose irritation and dryness room must be ventilated adding water tray can help drawbacks fan noise sometimes unbearable in calm room average build quality and finishing final words recommend this product cheap and effective unit for small to medium size rooms and it does not burn oxygen but makes dry air which can easily be overcome the prices could drop around sometimes so please check price before buying thanks for reading this if you have any doubts comment below on first day had faced some minor problem in this product but day after that day till now it working with no minor and major issues am happy on this product good purchased this usha heater which got delivered to me on th dec we use it moderately for just hrs in day it was working fine for days however on th day on jan night after around half an hour of running it suddenly started making khad khad khad sound and all its coil were red hot since we were awake just switched off the power from main switch it could have resulted into burning or fire if would have delayed for few more seconds when picked up the heater in hand it looked some part was loosened inside then on the next day on th jan lodged complaint with usha customer care na di was told the technician will visit within hrs however no one came in hrs so called up the technician on the number shared to me by usha on th after that technician visited me upon checking he found that out of fans one fan has loosened completely and fallen inside that is why it was making sound and coils were getting too much heated was relaxed that it not big problem and would be fixed quickly but to my surprise the plastic coupler to which the fan was screwed is not able to hold the screw tightly there was problem with the coupler what kind of quality it is that within few days of usage screw automatically loosenrd and coupler not able to hold it anymore adding to my surprise the technician was not having the new coupler for replacement he said he will check tomorrow and come back of part is available but he didn came back when called next day he said part is not available and has informed the company but can say when it will be available so called usha customer care again and they said yes techinician has reported part is not available na dwe are forwarding your request to service team to arrange the part asap since then have been calling usha customer care as well techinician everyday and both are throwing the ball on each other usha customer care is worst saying everytime that they are forwarding the request to concerned department and as soon as the part is available it will be replaced asked them how many days it may take as can keep on waiting for month they just said they can say when it would be available since it is too cold nowadays and heater is not working what is the use of purchasing this usha heater if they will replace it after month winter would have already passed by then this is worst after sale service from big brand like usha and it was not expected from usha if they don have the basic parts available with the service center what is the use of sending technician empty handed from now on will never recommend usha to anyone and if any usha representative is reading this post request to them to service my heater asap thanks go ahead the cord is very short and required amp plug point it eats up available oxygen in closed room using since one year found fit for house use,neutral
shape are getting change day by day think it will be lasting for yr the plug is not supported in the sockets which is used in our houses need to buy another socket of amp to make this product usable otherwise it will be of no use nice product it warm the bucket water in branded and good quality have used this product twice since the purchase and it good the cord length can be increased more so that it will be easy to use the water is getting heated in short span of time there is minimum and maximum marking on the heater and the heater should be immersed inside the water till the minimum markings compulsaryly so if are going to heat half bucket of water it won be used product is good wire lenth and cord lenth are enough super easy to use but packing shi se ki hui nhi hoti star for good product but removed star for bad packing nice one good,positive
short review really good product and sound quality is very nice good for living rooms about ft or even bigger space installed it and connected to tv using coaxial cable volume clarity bass everything is perfect overall value for money product long review have experience other company speakers like jbl and sony and had decided to buy those but this one is similar in sound quality treble is nice and crisp vocals sound nice even at higher volumes bass is amazing fills entire room with that boom sound watching movies and listening to music is much better now with these speakers used these for about days and overall experience is good sound bar not subwoofer size is big considering this is but for me this is perfect size as it matches my tv length and looks good subwoofer small and compact unit bass is amazing gives that boom effect in action scenes and when listening to music remote minimal but functional remote has all the required features in single click connectivity does not have optical spdif but that ok as coaxial option is available and mostly all tvs have coax connectivity only take look below for bluetooth connectivity overall bluetooth works very well except when you connect certain devices with newer hardware have smaller unit installed in another room and always used to watch movies on that speaker unit but after listening to this one feel sound and bass of that other unit is just very low this one really sounds good and makes watching movies and listening to music good experience note think the unit uses bluetooth if you have devices with new bt drivers or hardware when you connect such newer devices treble and sound quality has minor issue not much but still you can hear it in some situations that treble and vocals are not clear this is not an issue when you use your mobile to connect using bluetooth wanted crystal clear sound so have connected using coaxial cable and sound quality is amazing over wired connection sound quality is average not up to the mark the best but aux mode not working it would be good it the sound system was more better best nice prodect remote playback so best mujhe to acha laga tag zebronic,positive
shown pieces received only one also it not ft at all as mentioned did feel cheated charging is ok the reason opted for this is just that needed one phone charger with usb port it is actually set of three feet cables both working fine for me bought for emergency use and having no issues after month bought months back only product is good nice and value for money good product but be prepared for long lead time misleading title and description its not ft cable better to use original item just bought it so not sure of durability or sturdiness but it was very cheap and so wasnt sure how good will it work but it works perfectly fine,positive

since have just started using find it good product good quality very handy light portable and safe heater each rod consumes only watt of power so you may take the risk of keeping it on with one rod on for hours together with out the risk of over heating of cable mcb breakdown or fire it can be plugged in five ampere ordinary domestic socket without ampere power supply very nice like reflector is not stainless steel make and hence description in the web does not match however did not return the item as it it is waste of time never buy this product for use after one week its plastic frame melts itself and make smooky smell otherwise am mech engg and crompton has been alreay made great name in motors pumps,neutral
slow charging charging speed is not fast not happy with this product bcoz this is highly priced as compared to its quality and the wire is not actually retracted easily need to push in byhand scrumbles within the case not recommended it doesn support apple car play connectivity good quality but when winding down the cable most of the times gets entangled usefull charges but doesn support apple car play built in quality of plastic roll could have been better useful types in one time charging the device gets tangled easily if you don reel it in and out with both ends tangential to the housing reel otherwise it is compact and useful device to have in your car,neutral
small and compact literally the size of your hand heated up two cups of water to hot coffee temperature in few minutes great for the avid backpacker not the best but ok with price it is small so it only takes less space looks good it takes repeated auto swich of and on sessions to cook maggie actually purchased it for travelling purpose at least can get warm water and can make black coffee at any place at any time this purpose getting solve but it is not usable to boil eggs and other purpose like cooker rice etc cannot cook boil current consumption will be high good one product top stand should be included in the item,neutral

so about the product boom ultima as it goes by the name it really got the ultimate bass effect wires are great built and tangle free the audio jack is compatible with almost all devices and its gold plated as well just didn find the case it was missing from my product though they have given pairs of extra buds with different sizes overall it great wired in mic earphones go ahead and add to your cart you won regret it so first let talk about the external bulid quality is awesome even at such an affordable price looks have all colours of these earphones and all colours looks cool wire the wire quality is have these earphones from months and these haven tangled since also the rubber coating and the inside braided wires gives nice looking effect but thing have seen is the middle piece which have mic and buttons is degree reversed so many times it difficult to pick the right or left earphone without seeing but it is mentioned on the earphones so that becomes easy now about the main part the internals the sound quality is so so nice as you can see in my title solid you can listen any music like lofi or peacefull type and when it time for party you can listen rock bass boosted songs with such adorable quality its the true definition for true sound and at cheap prices bass quality is also good perfect for the ears and if want high bass tried it with max bass it can produce and that awesome but don listen high bass for long those can hurt ur ears really bad but noice cancellation is seems like there is no noice cancellation maybe its mentioned for the mic not for the earpiece obviously there are very high quality products then this product but those will alteast cost but will choose this product instead of one or less than because this cost less than or sometimes less than depends on sale but quality and services of these products are not less than of rs earphone in past of my earphone died but the coustmer care is so generous there services are so cool and quick so those got replaced within days it days because forgot the eslip if you mail them with everting ready it won take more than working days it an honest review by me and will definitely suggest you to but these edited their services are slower now don know why and it takes around week to weeks to get the refund if something happens to ur earphones also its been like year as of and saw some trend with it my brother earphones stop producing sound from one side evey months or so but mine earphones be with me for months it not problem though cause you can mail em regarding this this happened with me even with extra proper care of the earphone still the best earphones you can find at this price point not for high bass lovers everything was ok but as shown in the picture that you will get case along with earphones which was not there inside it only earphone and some earplucks were there this range very good product if your budget under definitely you can bye this product nice product product is good but the accessories like the pouch is not provided as mentioned in the description in the second delivery also despite the return of first delivery of the product for replacement with pouch product is good but needs to work on noise cancellation,neutral

so got this keybaord few days ago and it came in package that can be best described as being mauled by bear it was totally beaten up and inside the batteries of the keyboard ha come loose alsothough could just pop it back in no problem thankfully it works fine tested all the keys and they are functional so let get to the meat of the subject or paneer if you re vegetarian think this keyboard performance will vary according to your use case for me the primary objective was to get an android compatable keybaord since had shifted the majority of my wokrload from my laptop to my tablet checked the internet and settled on this little guy becaue of teh glowing reviews and from my friend who had the ink variant of the keyboard bought it along with the logitech pebble wireless mouse since it came in bundle and honestly don regret it both of them fir very well into my work type and they ve made my life lot more easier this is of course bluetooth keyboard and it does not have any wireless dongles hidden away in the chasse checked the keyboard has no backlighting as expected from wireless eyboard that runs on regular pen torch batteries and from my friends experience this battery will last you long time the major feature of this wireless keyboard over the other brands in teh market is the ability to switch between bluetooth capable devices with the press of button now personally thought that wouldn be using this feature all that much since was plaaning on using this keyboard for my android tablet but then realised that could set up my laptop as second device and switch between my tablet and laptop without any issues making it easier to type out papers on my laptop and responding to texts emails on my android tablet at the same time nowadays can stop using this feature since have my phone tablet and laptop paired to this keybaord and my productivity has become much more efficent it is honestly very neat the keys are rounded which is much more pleasant to type on than let say square keys and the slight inclination of the keyboard serves as good angle that reduces finger fatigue while typing this comes with no wrist rest so people who have had hand injuries should either look for another keyboard or buy the wrist rest seperately teh keys are membrane keys and they feel bit stiff in my honest opinion but nonetheless it has good feedback and the typing experience is very comfortable it does not have number pad as you migth have seen from the product images so if you are someone that crunches lot of numbers ine excel you might want to skip this keyboard the latency is quite low from my perspective don think they have that crispy logitech lightspeed tech built into it though but you won be using this for gaming and if you are planning to then please don this keyboard performs horribly in gaming and mean it terrible this is keybaord targeted at people who do lot of typing across multiple devices and it is built with portability in mind if am ambitious enough can probably stuff this keyboard into my pocket because of how small it is like my friends say have small hands well this keyboard was probably designed for rat because my hands are huge compared to this keybaord sometimes while am resting my hand on the homerow my ring finger accidentally presses one of teh mushy media buttons at the top and everything am doing goes into stasis but that is more of me problem than problem with this keyboard it does come with arrow keys which is very surprising they actually managed to squeeze it in mean that pretty much it for this keybaord don buy it for rs suggest waiting for discount because this thing is certainly not worth that much would say this is like rs keyboard but that just my opinion if you are buying this for the android experience then suggets buying it bunded with the mouse because both of them kind of complete each other with that being said going to conclude my review mouse came turned on apart from that no issues discovered till now it going good its one of the best budget keyboards have ever used the membrane keys are very soft and easy to click not lift off weight easy on the fingers its been around yr since bought this keyboard and iam using it ever since no issues so far and iam highly satisfied with my purchase definitely gonna recommend it very good typing experience so far caps lock indicator height isn adjustable no backlight the key travel is very very less please keep that in mind otherwise decent product at the price range bought this in combination with logitech pebble bluetooth mouse for the sole purpose of using it with my pad it has made my tasks easier and with recent pad os updates there are tons of shortcuts that make pad experience more productive since was going for retro looking device chose sand color makes me nostalgic about the old school computer devices that had similar finish connectivity is fast you just switch it on and it connected to your primary device in matter of seconds even less they keys are not silent but at the same time not loud enough to disturb your environment you can connect upto devices and switch between them seamlessly with the push of button also using the setup for gaming will maybe update later about that experience final comments ergonomic economic portable and lovely recommend buy for all who need to get work done fast this keyboard is awesome it has flawless connectivity and great size for portability just that it is not fitted with lift at the back and miss the backlight design but it is value for money product works flawlessly with mac as well as windows,positive
some buttons not working in first week of purchase quality not upto the mark as expected good product with great compatability with firestick liked the utility build and finish it not working moreover not being able to initiate return refund after so many tries,neutral
some keys could be better but in this budget it good enough use to play gta and fifa and some car racing games which are so good and vibration is so good in this budget good for this budget the product worked fine for months but after that the start button and select button of the controller went inside and it became defective and it stopped working so had to wait for weeks for the buttons to come back up and for it to work again since those two buttons are not crucial for playing the game it was manageable to some extent tbh it good if you are amateur gamer it completely fine at this price but if you are hardcore gamer pro level then will suggest you to pay bit more and go for better one because sometimes out of no reason some movements doesn work when play cricket suddenly in the middle of the match one shot selection doesn work and it disrupts the momentum still it decent product can say about durability now will update few months later less weight compared to other sticks the and is little hard but still playable battery backup is good the charging port is that not good thing because we all are using port chargers although for this price point it okay have been using this for weeks now and saw no flaws with this one the and are bit tight but other than that no issues ruff use lot when playing and this is very durable although it does not have markings for grip the grip is good too this one needed no extra installations and is plug and play just what needed doesn support all the time on windows the device is not recognisable most of tge times and you just need to plug and unplug the thing continuously,positive

somehow amazon sucks when you want to select an electric kettle there are no options to filter your choices based on the parameters that matter it is easy to fall into the trap of an ongoing deal and end up buying something that falls short of what you need in this review will answer your questions about the pigeon amaze plus electric kettle can trust the reviews for this ad are they genuine probably yes but know that the seller lists several types of pigeon kettles in the same ad unless the review refers to this particular model you could well end up seeing review of product and buying different one the ratings are also an aggregated mix there could be negative review of the product you are seeing and positives for the other products the page will show you neutral review that the game sellers are playing these days to avoid negative reviews have posted picture of the stove am referring to in this review wattage important because this tells how quickly the water will heat up this one is meaning that you can switch it on brush your teeth and find the water is boiled great time saving my earlier one was and it used to take minutes of patient waiting the gas stove boiled water faster this one takes about mins to heat mugs of coffee cable length most of these kettle makers skimp on the cable length have purchased kettles to find they have only foot long cable and had to return them this one has cable length of slightly more than one meter which is allows comfortable distance between the kettle and the plug connector this one uses plug which is most common in india be careful because from onwards most kettles use plug and that is not always available at the place where you want to place the kettle strictly speaking it should have plug but then this is kept on for short intervals only capacity litres as mentioned though could not see markings for max and min levels this is good enough to make decent sized mugs of coffee cooking other stuff the ad says only water but see no reason why you cannot heat maggi etc maybe you can but avoid milk as the expanding effect will cause spills and this can have adverse effects looks quite okay for the price it will not make your kitchen look bad and neither will it enhance the looks this is the most common look that an electric kettle can have performance have used for days only no complaints so far there is year guarantee card accompanying the product handle very convenient feel when you lift it it from the heating cradle does not feel very heavy even if there is full of water negatives this is steel jug the outside will automatically heat up if you are used to plastic outside in your previous kettle you need to be little careful verdict buy at the time of writing this review this costs less than rs have seen that sellers tend to inflate prices as they get my positive reviews therefore am also mentioning the price range based on which gave this product star review the body is very lightweight and doesn feel sturdy does the job of heating water fast and that it cord length could be little longer the plastic parts doesn feels sturdy the top cap has smaller dia so man hand has trouble fitting it inside the container during cleaning and can easily cut our hands overall it okay its quality was not too much good light quality product but according to price its okay easy to use product good for save time good product for boiling water shock proof so no worries hahaha cattle bass fitting not currently good product go for it amazing product,neutral

sound quality is good enough loud at volume bass is also ok mic quality is also good in indoor condition receiver can clearly listen to you didn use it in noisy environment or in outdoors company claims there is low latency while gaming don know exactly if it works or not sound call quality wise it good one but the problem is with battery backup company claim it will give battery backup of hours with case hours in single charge additional hours times charge via case this is misleading it only gives total hours playback ve tested it myself it will give around hours backup on single charge of buds volume if you only listen to music or watching video but no call or gaming you can charge the earbuds full only times via case so additional hours if you try to charge after nd time it will only charge the buds around then it goes off after st charge the case has battery left nd time it is down to then rd time it goes to they mentioned earbuds have mah battery each mah battery in case it is mentioned in product manual but in boat website it is written mah instead of technically hours backup is also not possible it has mah battery in case it acts like mah powerbank so let assume it efficiency is so it will give output of mah it is less than mentioned capacity due to energy loss while energy transfer now each earbud has mah so total mah now buds can be charged via case times that it having bought this for roughly must say that not too satisfied with the product in many ways pairing is very simple and it connects very quickly the build quality is actually very good it all plastic but it looks quite durable as long as you re not too rough with it audio is decent not too impressive my wired earphones boat bassheads are quite frankly much better this is not for gaming play call of duty mobile and the latency is just painful even with beast mode turned on felt no difference as the the lag still persisted the battery backup is actually great the only positive thing can think of is the battery backup got roughly hours of playtime and the battery had drained from to the quick charge is cherry on top overall say it performance is very average definitely not worth in my opinion not adaptive for every person ear my wife doesn suit the ear airdopes partially satisfied rupees bought don bought more than for this model the product was as good as expected the quality is good noise cancellation isnt quite high but overall good battery lifespan more better audio but calls are not audible properly some times it works best for the price sound quality is good but plastic quality is average no clear sound on call creating disturbance during call,neutral
sound quality is ok noise cancellation is not upto the mark volume is good overall for the price its worth product the cushion on the mic comes out easily couldnt have been fixed properly good the built design is ok for the product everytime wear and do the resizing my hair gets stuck in the band which is irritating rest sound and all is good stopped using it after continuously using for hrs for office use it can not be used for long duration calls or back to back meetings ears starts paining after hours use speaker cover is very thin will give this device to someone needy sound quality and built quality is nice but comfort is huge issue with this device due it tight overhead band it keeps both sides on ear for getting better sound or noice cancellation but the one who is looking for noice cancellation will buy over ear bigger headphones use all types of headphones over ear on ear earbuds earlier used sennheiser on ear headphones but it never gives pain ideally if anyone buying on ear simple headphones then it is for calls or meetings where they still want to hear sound in their room some attention to sound in your room for example keeping an eye on kids while being in meeting basic padding or multiple layer soft covers for on ear will be helpfull guys go for ball rocker over ear or hp over ear wired headphones for long duration office calls it cost less compare to this logitech device however this is still good buy for upto mins use for session call meeting and then break only issue for people having back to back meetings nice quality bought this because had to work from home and had to take calls my only worry was the noise cancellation because live next to busy road and am happy with the purchase as the noise cancellation is working great people on the other side of the call have never complained about any kind of background noise the plastic quality used is great and it not squeaky the wire is long enough the sound output is good enough but don intend to listen any music on these if you need something for music then this is wrong product con the cushion is not adequate and starts hurting the ear lobes within mins had some extra cushions so added those over the ear piece build quality is not that good but sound quality noise cancellation is best in the range of less than after covid our life changes lot online meeting conferences webinar even online classes became new normals in this situation good headphone with mic is necessary for doing work flawlessly and this headphone has everything which needed audio quality is good and crystal clear without any additional noise mic is also very good with good noise cancellation thanks to amazon for their service and ontime delivery getting early delivery for the product was bit urgent for me and it was delivered in almost hour after placing order am fully satisfied with the product highly recommend for students and working professionals who have limited budget you wont regret it only thing am missing is volume control on headphone,positive
sound quality is superb noise cancellation is extremely well but bass quality needs improve ment overall its great the only thing thats poor is the range its not even half meter rest is good good it very good headphone compared to it price previously had used sony headphones and those were bit expensive but can surly say that these headphone can give you satisfactory quality good battery backup like the color and bass build quality is not good enough the cousin cover get torn with use fit gets loose over battery life is decent like,positive

stop working after few days ok it doesn fit easily little water pressure the filter falls off fitting is draw back for the product water purification method implied is good installation must be made easy having hair problem due to water so bought this for my bathroom good quality product but after using it for couple of days filtered water pressure has reduced pros easy to install pipe comes with different dimensions cons hoped it to purify the tap water as mentioned in their description unfortunately doesn serve the purpose measured my usual water with tds ppc meter the result was usual for bangalore after installed this filter it showed the result of disappointing you need it less than to be sure to drink it easy to install value for money used it for school project and it worked super well old product received inside seems as rusted,negative
stopped working after month of use don waste your money on this product everything is best but build quality is avg lets get directly into the pros cons sry it will be long review coz the review have to be useful for everyone who plans to buy this pros the price given to this price bracket its the best one can suggest from the built quality to the audio quality its superior for the price got for this price tag then the comfort everybody complaining about the earpads dont know why if your going for over the ear type have to be known that cant wear it all day long the most expensive products also tend to warm your ears and get little uncomfortable so if its not preffered can go for earphones or earbuds as bought multiple ober the ear headphones there will be rought cloth like texture that will irritate your ears but this one has soft cushion like material im really comfortable with this one and next the audio quality have previosuly owned boult in ear earphones so know the bass quality and vocal quality so booked this without even thinking twice and it has delivered what it can the best part is im really comfortable in this one than my in ear earphones the sound is even better and you dont get high volume levels like those local cheap products on the markets but the bass and clarity will give you some extra feel especially the bass its really engaging if ur bass lover go for it then the quality know the boult for sometime but for over the ear headphones at this price point was little skeptical about the build quality before the delivery and it suprised me dont think that build quality is extraordinary like sennheiser or sony coz ur not paying that much for this so for this price its so good even better than the boat headphones which is slightly high in the price tag now cons little skeptical about the warranty because when gone to register this and both while was registered my boult in ear earphones they didnt asked for invoice slips and no serial number is asked then how can they proceed if we call for the warranty claims but hopefully think this will last long as seeing the quality next is the cable quality didnt complaining about it but they mentioned in amazon as its an kevlar cable so expected lott but its normal cable bt its sturdy enough didnt check the mic on it make call on this the other person was able to understand me but dont know hows the quality to help you guys have metioned every aspect in detailed manner so it can helpful for people who spend their valuable money coz every single rupee counts have nice and safe shopping bye achhi product he got the product delivered unharmed in days got it for this is the best branded product in this price range sound quality is pretty good considering the price bass is good but the loudness is bit low you have to listen them above the level of your mobile clearity is very good bought them for online lectures and they worked great for the purpose ear cups are comfortable and reduces much background noise besides they aren known for passive noise cancellation the wire attached to the ear cups is bit delicate and may break if pulled forcefully so you have to handle it carefully have attached pic with side by side comparison of my old boat rockerz which bought for in and they lasted for very long duration of years the boult audio looks bit delicate as compared to boat rockerz but don forget there double price difference between them let see how long it goes summing up this is the best product in this price segment just go for it if you get the same noise level is so high couldn listen more than minutes so like to choose another brand please refund for this product quality not as expected level use this product for mostly in gaming and listening songs but there are no mic in it,neutral

sturdy packing good product have used this brand cable for my phone and pad before so when my wife samsung charger cable gave up the ghost in less than months ordered this braided visibly high quality cable unlike the flimsy and highly overpriced oem cables from apple and samsung have been using my phone cable from wayona for more than years and still going strong hope this cable will give similar performance like wayona chords and especially the long ones but get slight shock like static discharge when touch my phone while charging with these two cords other cords with same charger are okay ok cable looks solid and length is also good little bit fast charging observed for phones like redmi it also looks solid so am expecting it to work for atleast year build quality and fast charging feature unbreakable good quality cable nice product,positive
suction power mentioned no where on product spec or packaging but surprisingly it having good suction do most of the cleaning effortlessly purchase ltr version which having button to control suction it some what true that suction reduced when dust cylinder is somewhat full but resolved issue by emptying dust cylinder and cleaning filters it somewhat tricky to remove cylinder itself for cleaning do it carefully ow will break plastic locks it very similar to midea vaccum cleaner available in uk with kpa all extension pipes are of steel make is it difficult to work with due to weight btw it don have blower function the price of product and performance make it best buy vacuum it worth for the price given and does it job perfectly only concern on my personal experience had was the extension cord provided is made of steel and it bit heavy and we can hold it for long while cleaning the spider webs in roofs rest all good suction power is okayish its good product value for money but can do much better with good suction power it doesnt remove most of the dust takes too much effort it is good choice if you are looking for vacuum cleaner under it is worth for the price nice product worth the money suction power is good cord length sufficient for home purpose noise level is also low right now please go for it it has excellent suction power easy to carry around and has different options for cleaning things good product for this price very usefull and comparatively very good when compared with costly vaccum cleaners in dust cup is just awesome only drawback is no blowing out,positive
sufficient length excellent build quality good alternative to generic cables strong cable the cable ends are nearly like rubber gold coated cable is also of high thickness why bought this have dvr rack for dvr which is far above the reach limit hence need mouse to be connected to the usb port of the dvr which is in the rack above reach any alternatives wireless mouse didn work well with my particular dvr had lots of lag hence had to resort to usb port extender with ample length result very sturdy cable able to connect to my dvr and connection is stable amazon basics is very reliable this cable is good for any device that needs extension over usb like printers tvs gaming consoles keyboards etc the build quality is good cable material is soft so it will not break connectors are gold plated and will not rust but remember this cable will not give usb speeds even if you connect it to usb port for usb any usb if used will behave as usb type adirection female to male function extension of length of usb built average not cloth fibre braider length as mentioned works for all connections yes including pc printer console pen drive etc product is as per description good as expected,positive

superb easy to use and low sound hearing good look value of the money good product fine grinding nice product good,positive
superb using this in my car from months quality of product is as described and it working very good with my redme note pro quickly charged under min to mah battery you just need fast charger the purpose of me using this is not for charging but as an attachment for portable dac to mobile for iems build quality is really good ends are really premium transfers sound without as such without noticeable loss or additions cannot comment on its durability will update the same later the best you can get bit pricey but then its not easily available in local market thnx to duracell that they have this its convenient if hv reverse charging from your phone use it for digital lock that we have on our home door yes it great product for me it charges my samsung galaxy which has usb port with the new samsung charger which has type port but be careful as it charges at it does the job pretty well but it made in china whereas the samsung charger is made in india this thing from duracell meets the expected expectation no wonder very good quality,positive
take it my food habits in three weeks better result light great designeasy manouverabilityfast heatingwhat else can one want absolute go for product go for it good simple light and easy to use best at its price temperature control pr its too light to handle and works good with this sole plate as dry iron this iron box does the job its light weight and irons well,positive
takes space and not convenient if in hurry the handheld model would be better suited and more useful for frequent use used this product once after reading the manual the first impression after using it on cotton shirts without starch and one pant is pathetic none of the shirts got wrinkle free on full steam hence you could guess what it would be in trousers later found it is satisfactory on silk nylon shirts shirts etc but none will get an iron effect wrinkle will be there in small amount and slight wet feel when the steam cool down but it will go if fast it is mainly useful for ladies who wear embroidered nylon silk materials stone work fabrics etc etc men who use shirts and nylon rich trousers otherwise don even think of buying it in my case use cotton whites and white trousers mainly at office as am lawyer hence for me it is totally useless no females at home and hence it is another product that grab my home space regarding comfort while using it would say am totally disappointed as the board behind it is not much of use while using shirt because of its size which is not that long the last two button downwards will always hard to press it to board and we have to take the hanger hold high on one hand and thus another difficult part as the nylon material needs another hands to hold it firm secondly the long full sleeves are totally difficult to do it though steam is applied the wrinkles won go easily add we are not pressing it to board and it will always go here and there the top stand is hanger shaped but the clips attached as useless as the board comes in between for trousers the product itself won work good so if we use the hanger it comes with you need to put the switch off place the handle in slot take the shirt out and then only we can use the back side to steam after waiting again to steam up switch on etc otherwise steam will go on coming out of it any way the product is more useful that those similar without pressing board the next negative thing is manual says for better lasting of product and to avoid decalcification the water after use should be drained and cleaned hence it means you can use it daily morning in rush while going to office that needs little time at the same time you can press all dress in stretch and can fold it like we do with iron box it won work that away so if you have long large cupboard with hangers as in mansions you can try that in effect buy it if you find exceptions and usages apart from what mentioned above am seriously thinking of olx received broked packedge with broken item thought it would make my task of ironing easy but its useless on cottons and silks its great to use it on chiffon and polyester do not buy thinking you wont need standard ironing anymore it is fantastic for marriages where there are many dresses net based where you can use iron quick good for suits it looks like an imitation product pieces dont match properly and some look very weak valu ed for money its not effective and pressing clothes effectively seems to have an issue,positive
technical specifications here the technical information of boat bass heads in ear headphones the information provided below is as per the manufacturer boat bass heads have frequency range of hz to hz it features mm drivers rated impedance of ohms comes with meter flat tangle free cable mm gold plated shaped audio jack degrees sensitivity built quality design was not expecting metal built at this price range but to my surprise boat bass heads are fully made up of metal it has diagonal grid like texture on the buds which feels amazing on touch the metal construction gives boat bass heads premium feel attractive appearance the cable used by boat on bass heads is flat with rubberized coating it is tangle free cable does it job well by decreasing the chances of the cable tangling despite the metal construction boat bass heads are very lightweight comes with microphone shaped mm audio jack which is again made up of metal overall the built quality is excellent for the price seems very durable the ear buds have proper labels and are clearly visible boat bass heads comes with medium sized silicone tips already installed out of the box audio quality to ensure that can test the bass heads at their uppermost limit used high quality mp files of kbps lossless audio formats like flac wav for smartphone listening used poweramp music player tweaked settings every now and then to see their extreme capability for the computer used tunes player vlc audio player also tested these earphones on apple pod phone sony mp player all this went for more than days finally had my results boat bass heads promised what they claimed they really are very bassy as compared to others during my tests with them found that the audio quality is very good for the price the bass output is amazing and overpowers the vocals by default by tweaking the equalizer settings bit saw good level of improvement in the vocals they were clearer than before but overall average the treble was again very good the high frequency sounds were clear pleasant to ears the mids were average but overall the audio experience on boat bass heads was decent when listening to music the overall sound quality is amazing you can easily distinguish between different instruments sounds which is good thing for extra bassy headphones noise isolation comfort when it comes to noise isolation boat bass heads are very good at it they come with medium sized ear tip pre installed which seemed perfect for my ears once the earphones are on wasn able to hear outside noise they sealed my ears completely delivered an immersive experience make sure that you have the right pair of ear tips on for better noise isolation comfort overall boat bass heads are comfortable but they seem bit stiff somewhat awkward when used for longer periods since the housing is made up of metal you may find them popping out every now then when used during running jogging or any other sport or physical activity this didn happen as often for me but for friend they keep popping out every now then while running maybe the shape of ears has something to do with it an easy solution to this will be using the ear hooks which came along with it when using bass heads with ear hooks they were bit uncomfortable initially but as got used to them they were fine plus this stopped popping issue since the hooks keep hold on them flat cable microphone the cable is great personally prefer flat cables and this earphone come with perfect flat cable which is tangle free comes with rubberized coating the cable does its job well the microphone is again exceptionally good it records voice with clarity with less to no disturbance or background noise during calls the person on the other end can clearly hear the voice with no background disturbance there is one button on the microphone which helps to pick up reject calls on the go without taking your phone out it can also be used to control music which is again good to see in budget friendly earphone like boat bass heads warranty price boat bass heads comes with standard one year warranty so make sure you keep the purchase invoice safe in case you need it for warranty final thoughts ve personally used boat bass heads in ear headphones for more than two weeks average daily two hours of listening before writing this review and pretty much impressed with them personally fan of extra bass iem and currently my primary iem is sony mdr xb ap which again falls under extra bass category comparing sony mdr xb ap with boat bass heads will be unfair since there is big price difference between both of them but would still like to add that bass heads did great job and didn disappoint me obviously it doesn stand chance in front of sony mdr xb ap but still looking at the price of bass heads the quality they offer was really very impressed boat bass heads turned out to be exceptional earphones after testing them for more than two weeks with different devices music players can say that they re amazing for the price pure steal deal the bass output is amazing and is very intense ll recommend using correct size ear tips good quality music player like poweramp android for better bass output the treble is good vocals are average somewhere feel that bass overpowers the vocals but by tweaking the equalizer bit you can achieve better results the mids are again average my rating out of the verdict taking everything into account overall very impressed with boat bass heads the built quality is amazing the performance is exceptionally good with powerful bass good overall soundstage tweaking the equalizer bit can bring drastic improvements to other areas like vocals mids highs overall the vocal highs are good mids are average but still good for the price ll recommend these iem to bass lovers budget conscious people who are looking for high quality durable earphones at reasonable price genres like edm rock hip hop sound really great on them boat bass heads justify the price they come for the results are very good as compared to other earphones in same price range hope helped you thanks yes so you have heard that this is the best wired earphone under yes you can consider it to buy but there are few points to remember before buy from my user experience can tell you this this is not comfortable at all it slips from ear mostly you feel pain in ear after using it never buy this for online class as it is not possible to wear it hours straightly after switching from boat basshead feel that the bass is not good as the previous one don know why it should be better sound don explode or go outside of the buds to as it go outside on boat headphone so its good feeling heavier on ears not as comfortable as realme buds though both are metal build for balance sound you can buy realme buds buy it only to listen music not for too long time do not consider it for online class and long time wear session hope it helped you its just my opinion from using boat boat boat realme buds mi basic it very good product but don recommend buying this because earpiece is heavy and you need to keep adjusting it and pushing it inside whenever you move your head they will fall off easily with the slightest motion you will soon find it annoying sound quality build quality everything is good but earphones falling off ears will irritate you raat me apne babu se dhere dherebaat krne pr aacha se sunae deta purchased the product year ago it worked fine love the sound quality but you may not expect it to work after year my headphone doesn work now properly my warranty get expired so have to buy new one good buy but side earphone stopped after month sound quality is above average but got years old manufactured ear phones build quality is as per cost can expect much there is buzzzzz sound when music is silent the earphones sound is awesome,positive
thank you amazon the length is too small ok so before bought it with my old cable thought that the speed was standard with an hdd about years old but once got it man is it fast highly recommend it if your hdd has slowed down it probably the cable that came stock with your hdd that slowing it down yes good cable length is very small like cm but transfer speed is good to mb good it working fine even after months amazing product meet all your expectations,positive

the biggest issue with buying an accessory for an apple product from non apple supplier is you will never know if this will work this products is working used it an old pod touch am able to charge and transfer data hope the product has good shelf life as well value for money after bad experience with fast charging cable for pad was apprehensive to buy any such thing online but then decided to try once more with amkette to my delight the cable fitted the port and started charging the pad charging is slower than the original apple cable but it will do if you re not heavy user good value for money hope it works for more than months at least loose the hope to revive my phone found in some old items old cable was damaged and not able to charge it ordered the cable just to check if my old phone can revive even after almost years without charging got the cable on time and the quality of packing and cable look impressive and to my surprize my phone got charged and started working am thankful the cable helped me to revive my old phone working with pod perfectly not good product fits well fast charging great product my pad become live again very good condition and its useful for me,positive
the blower functionality is good the brush nozzle is not good it breaks on sharp corners overall its worth buying for small cleaning very premium look and feel product works well use it to clean my laptops and other electronics really like this portable wireless vaccum cleaner using it for cleaning my car it comes with charging cable user manual and multiple cleaning brushes charging capacity is awesome suction power is very good easily catch dust particles inside car it is best value for money thank you amazon this is probably the most portable and useful vacuum cleaner that have come across compact and portable its cordless and hassle free great suction power and it is so convenient to use its vacuum and blower both its is easy to clean so it requires no maintenance it is exactly what needed sturdy simple small and smart vacuum machine it has great suction power wish it had little bit bigger storage box blower leaks air and if it to be used efficiently vacuum cleaning averagethey should have designed it like tunnel use it as vacuum cleaner remove the filter and accessories to be used blower in reverse really like our portable cordless vacuum clener it handy lightweight and easy to use it great for quick clean ups and does good job on our cars floors etc had it for few weeks now and it still going strong,neutral
the build quality is good not sure on the reliability front lets see in few months the sound quality is satisfactory there is reduction in sound which is expected during conversion anyway but considering the price its negligible overall good buy will recommend this one especially for tvs without optical out and just coax spdif out how relace it with warranty for converting digital audio of sony bravia xr uhd to sony dav dz kanalogue with sound ouput first device did not work may be my error replacement device is excellentit is giving me virtual effect while watching movies on disney hot star and amezon primemy cyears old dav dz home theaterwithout any digital output is giving perfe ct virtual effect on pcm audio replacement device was delivered by amezon injust two days time excellent service by amezon thanks also to tube from where learned my lessons of installing this classic device was very disappointed on st device and as there is no return policy asked for replacement and it worked very welland now am very happy and would like to recommend to people who have new tv without any analog output and has only digital and hdmi output and old home theater systems with only analog component or composit output thank you amezon for this diwali gift doesn provides surround sound very nice product am using it last few months sound quality is very good good soooo nice good,positive
the button contacts are not very good doesn look as standard and durable as original product purchased from seller smart place store remote works but low build quality not original material is very average works as described not meet expectations but it good product parts are likely to break even in case of small fall,neutral
the cable build quality is good for normal charging its great cable but doesnt support quick charging works for charging but other applications are hit or miss example my external keyboard doesn work with it best quality and length of wire was qute good and durability also good the cable is awesome and no charging issue till now because it is braided cable chance of it damage are very less overall like the product using this cable from past days to charge lg thinq and samsung fe so far super good seems durable but there is problem with the design that the pin is not long enough base of the pin is too thick that couldn insert it into my phone charging port without removing the case over all quality bht achhi hai bs jo braided material use hua hai wo nylon nhi hai cotton type ka hai lekin me cable hisaab se bht achhi hai majboot hai or charging bhi thik hai maine chapti wali buy ki thi jo photo me dikh rhi hai lekin delever ye gol wali hui jo ki jada better look deti hai agar me mile to mt lena utne layak nhi hai,positive
the cable does support fast pd charging have tried it on my laptop and also tried it on the powerbank tested on the samsung watt charger and it worked fine for the phone tried the same on charger on laptop for pd charging though it charged the laptop but the cable point does heat up quite bit so there are chances that if watt charger is used it may heat up lot overall the cord is well make very sturdy and the materials indicate that this cord will be very very durable the price would could have been on the lower side due to heating otherwise its good buy good for buy like it got this for my samsung lite and it is compatible with super fast charger and charged my phone in super fast charge mode value for money could not post picture but product is good far better than original samsung cable which cost almost same the cable is sterdy the ends are premium charges my one plus rapidly great data transfers on my macbook as well am happy with the purchase good cable worth it quality of cable is very good supports fast charging in samsung galaxy devices ideal for charging but not for data transfer gives an average speed of to mbps with my ssd capable of more than mbps transfer speed and actually gives with its provided cable,positive
the cable is efficient in fast charging but in quick data transfer overall fine like the usb shape nylon shielded core wire it improves the life of the cable think buy these every months or so fast charging stops working after while probbly something to do with the cable design the cable gets twisted over time and suspect that breaks the high capacity wires inside but keep buying it because there arent too many options in an shaped design good and durable product sometime the charges doesn work on few adapters there might be few cut off or something but works fine on apple adapter car charger usb the product is really good at affordable price good and fast charging and value for money wat not fast charger very slow charging with shape pin is very useful,positive
the cable is good slightly thicker than the apple original cables and is only good for charging it doesn work for data transmission contrary to what some one has mentioned in the replies to one of the queries not at least with apple products it charges my pad pro with chip but freezes it if used for data transmission any one looking for data transmission better find something else this item is only good for charging works fine no issues so far as per belkin product page there is no mention that it supports belkin support in section says it supports only needs to be investigated if it really is fast charging or not scummy behaviour from belkin to not specify such basic spec belkin com us cables charging boost charge usb to usb cable cab all belkin products are of excellent quality and build thanks to belkin for providing good products and thanks to seller and amazon for selling this product excellent product guess it only belkin compared to the rest of the third party companies which make quality cables you can feel the quality in your hands worth it although you may find it to be expensive as expected,positive
the cable looks exactly as it is shown in the picture can say about durability of this product because have purchase this on th december after to months will update my review about the durability and the cable works fine good one used it for long time had no complains good thanks works well perfect for laptop charging it good to have it for rs delivered in days,positive
the cable was safely delivered and works well with my watch perfect watch for my noise watch quality finish and charging capacity are efficient universal fit and at low cost fits with my smart watch and band perfectly the cable is perfect fit for my noise colourfit nav it good product worth buying thanks to amazon good worth for the money like it this is value for money worth the money,positive
the camera is good phone is quite respponsive fast charging there are some niggling software issues and do not forget password pin there is no way you will be able to get it back to factory settings this is my second iqoo pro and my humble advice to all the users and purchasers out there is that please do not update your device to the latest software version doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues speak from my experience my first iqoo pro gb is updated to the latest august security patch update and drains battery at the rate of percentage overnight for no specific reason the idle drain is very pronounced however my second iqoo pro which purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain so think it best not to update till iqoo rolls out better update resolving the battery drain issue above average performance no heating issue fastest fingerprint reader face unloak good battery life ok camera quality light weight comfortable on hand all the features of this mobile was good no doubtly anyone can buy this but nor for games withinh the budget only it was available for me dual tone flash light is not working think it only single led light two things missing pin hole camera earphones jack overall camera excellent but battery life not good maximum hours as this price limit its good mobile with camera battery screen quality,positive
the color cartridge ink levels were low during printer set up the packaging was torn and damaged leads me to question if this was refurbished product that was delivered to me print quality is good ink gets over after few prints product got delivered on next day of order pack was intact many complained on the printer ink they pack ink tanks so we cannot expect more prints belive we need to wait and watch on usage print quality was good good scanner had tough time on installing it on windows since it end up saying printer not connected tried to reach support line and they said it is carry in warrnty and shared the local agent number to walkin and fix managed to install the driver manually and able to add the printer it we need to pick the usb sure it will have cannon word on it by default it picked ltp for me and was not able to connect to printer after changed the usb and picked the correct connection printer started working without any issue will update the journey very nice product good probably it for regular use not for residential with few uses the inkjets become dry too fast making it very expensive to maintain good,neutral
the color is not same as what is shown in images rest the quality is good go for it it is useful and strong also but buy in sale or discounted price only best for daily use bit be alert from delivery man of dtdc of amazon even they are ready for anything like gundas using from several months very good product if you want to avoid the cable this is best product eco dot rd product does its work but quality can be improved edges are not smooth and is made of poor quality plastic no shine but dull outlook still ok to buy in this price the product correctly holds the echo dot as well as the cables without hindering the flat placement on the wall the position of the holder can be shifted slightly as well in terms of distance from the wall because the holder can slide on the adapter these are the biggest pros for the product as for the cons the product could improve on the plastic quality and texture quality need to improve but not bad happy to purchase if your power outlet is not going to hold the charger stronger don go for it it might fall down,positive
the cover felt sturdy and came in sealed package there were protective films covering the cover from both side which had to be removed before putting cover on the phone the fit was perfect and to take off the cover we might need to use some force overall the quality is good will update after few months of usage about the colour fading scratches the cover wraps around the iphone pro max too tightly making it difficult to remove once put but at the same time the cover feels solid and sturdy providing complete protection the phone excellent product avoid local market product for such premium phones value for money excellent normal transparent one but the price they are asking is too much like they are trying to loot ppl awesome bought this as spigen is decent brand this is my initial case as am waiting for better cases to be designed and released overall decent case with decent protection for the phone and cameras this product is of good quality,positive
the covers are sturdy flexible and compelling the back of the notebook has nice texture to it as well would say that the quality of the pages is well above par and it does feel great when writing on it it particularly helpful for students who take notes of separate subject lectures on the same copy and they are eventually scrambled up if not maintained properly it also beneficial to students who create notes mostly using charts tables diagrams and the like as there division after pages and you can write as much in depth definitely good still the books are in great condition and worth the price only thing different is the cover nothing else worth for rs which paid good notebook quality is good but its size is small compared to my normal notebooks overall decent product very good quality book notebook ki size chhoti or without line ke pages mere according to ye th class tk ke bachcho ke liye thik hai,positive
the decision to buy this purely on the cost of similar branded item is around rs use this vacuum cleaner only occasionally and based on my need and feel floor requires vaccum cleaning under the above condition this item serves purpose conss made in china and they importing and marketing in india sound feel not at my comfort zone but others also make similar noise lenth of power chord smaller compared to other brander ones no demo was arranged you tube video was their reply for my request for demo even in metro like bangalore no customer support or services in case instrument goes faulty over time in bangalore donot know how they service the instrument over phone who has to bear to the cost of transportation and how it will workout pros works as per the specification suction power is good noise level ok free movement there can be an improvement in the sponge quality since while using the blower the same gets sucked in the steel tub further if the company can provide video on how to effectively use the product it would be great and also how to avoid pressure on the motor since the hose pipe bends while using the product nice product liked suction power but on right side extra blowing out apart from blower side dont why and steel body build quality is too low if small partical touch it ll get dent its ok over all product is good ok ok the suction power of the vaccum cleaner is really good only drawback is that after using it for some time observed that the suction hose is leaking the air which is making whistling sound tried reaching out the customer service and they informed me that the whistling sound when using the blower mode is quite normal the outer container is made of steel and is of good quality when received the product observed dent in the body bought recently and initial usage is quite good it convenient and easy to use performs well on floors mattress and sofas blower function works as expected bit tough to clean mosquito mesh through grills have been using this vaccume cleaner for the last month and am very happy with the product have been using it mostly for sofa cleaning it suction power is really good pipe should have more length can reach slabs other wise nice,positive
the delivery people were not careful with the unpacking amazon needs to train their delivery staff on unpacking different types of things since they have come up with policy where they need to open the package and verify any defects stars to them as they are not careful with the unpacking could see that they were holding the tv panel while getting the tv out from the box and even after telling them to be careful they weren also the stand was just thrown on the front panel cause he has nit understanding where it was at when they opened the box which could have damaged the screen howerver very satisfied with the sony installation the engineer has good hands on and very experienced with the installation tv picture quality is good wi fi connection is little slow but it works mostly fine if router is nearby delivery was good and fast the sony installation service is very poor near bengaluru guy came late next day to scheduled day that too after calling many times he came and went like bullet doesn tell most of the things about tv like need to update system and all but overall tv works fine we have inch bravia song tv contacted after this review and resolved all below issue thank sony tv picture and sound quality is very good its to good but in software so many bugs wifi auto connectivity issue need to connect your same wifi again and again sound setting after conecting sound bar need if we selected speaker audio system then need to use remotes to do sound adjustment in my mi tv am using only tv remote to adjust sound and aame connectivity same soundbar unable to connect soundbar via bluetooth in mi tv same sound bar connected easly remote size is so big so many falatu keys in remote like ro no keys fast forward keys etc and in down side blank space and aftrr software update seen little picture quality low as compare before software update the tv is great at this purchase price sony tvs are generally very adaptive colour and picture qualty is really good sound is nice as well would however advise to use external speakers with tv of such size if you dont wish to purchase sound bar go for this model the picture quality is beautiful works with apple play its win win got the for my bedroom on great offer and yeah its sony wonderful purchase absolutely worth it best tv in its segment outstanding built quality sony tv may seem little bulky compared to some other fancy tvs but have seen over the years that they never compromise on quality was little skeptical about picture clarity since it is big tv but found it better than expected sound quality is also very good for led tv non hd channels are little less clear not bad though still it is good but it obvious seeing screen size has complained on tv getting struck their dealer called while was driving requested to call visit for tv reset later their service manager came into conference call listened over he advised dealer to treat the service call as closed without issue being resolved and dealer service centre till date not resolved issue our tv is still getting hung sometimes and we are managing by restarting tv every time have recently bought the inch model the picture sound quality is good it does not come with an anti glare coating do not install the tv in front of the window,positive
the earphones have good clear sound quality it lacks base battery backup is good anc is myth in this earphone it might hurt your ear if you wear it for longer duration depending on the shape of your ear eat easily fit in ears and light weight and sound quality is good too over all its worth to by this samsung buds ita connects well to the samsung mobile too bought this solely due to its form factor to try how samsung has made them to sound in this open bud style to be true samsung has managed excellently to give us an unique tws this is not an inear style tws but resembles somewhat earbud style tws only of its kind in the market as far as my knowledge goes they are held very good in my ears gives me good seal and does not fall out strange as can use earbuds because they fall out frequently it seems that samsung has finalised the shape after good homework however it doesn mean that it will fit everybody as there are many dissatisfied users around the globe the finish build and all such generic factors are top notch the size of the buds and the case is very small now about the sound if the buds fit in one ears with good seal the sound is full bodied but if the seal is not perfect it may be tinny the sound signature is very bassy for my taste and have to eq it to my taste the bass is so pounding that sometimes it becomes difficult to get taste of the treble listen it in treble boost mode adjusted through the app anc works strangely and noise reduction is not very decipherable in contrary anc on somewhat opens up the sound don buy this for anc strangely to me these buds sound better on my phone mini than my galaxy spotify and apple music the buds have app support for both android galaxy wear and os galaxy buds live but the android app is more feature packed and works better the os app couldn update the firmware although there is menu in the app and always showed the device to be on latest firmware however as soon as connected with my on pairing the first thing it did was to update the firmware love these buds solely for their form factor and they are pretty good for against an mrp of the do sound very good but does not suit my taste persons loving bass may love them don get them for anc battery consumption not yet fully tested but seems ok it has wireless charging too if your ears are too small or too large than normal better not to buy as they may either not go in the ears or will fit loose giving improper seal best call quality noise cancelling could have been improved to best but still wotks good descent battery life music is good not to that top notch but good in this segment overall worth for buying with good call quality very little to compromise but good am using this for like months it is good and productive if you are in the samsung ecosystem if you are not part then do not buy it its not worth its price bluetooth range is not that good the sound quality is extremely good for tws and the sound signature is almost flat got these for rs it almost felt like steal deal for me until faced one cardinal flaw in the design of these buds the bluetooth antenna has an absymal performance it feels like am using bluetooth the range is so poor that even if you put the phone in the pocket the audio starts stuttering the mic quality is hit or miss inside the house it works very well but outside it performs poorly think it has more to do with poor antenna design than the microphone quality if you are thinking that maybe the faulty product is an exception then do google search about its range issue and you will find hundreds of people complaining about the same thing samsung has poorly implemented the design and is reluctant to admit its fault pity those who bought it at around for such flawed product even at rs it is not worth it because of the range issue it is better to buy wired iem atleast it will sound better than this in this price samsung brand is good easy to wear and good battery backup hardly support the meter bluetooth connectivity,positive
the edges may start gapping out but overall quality including touch sensitivity is good as for the price tag the packaging was very nice there was microfibre cloth in the box though it was basic liked it now the main product it was just perfect in size installation process was quite simple but tempered glass is very fingerprint catchy in harsh lighting the fingerprints could be noticed easily product is otherwise good but attracts too much visible finger impressions during routine use with clean hand quite easy to install very easy even for beginners installation was smooth after installing it screen is responsive does what it is for,positive

the first time tried it send the eggs and the milk cream all over the kitchen big mess so suggest that you try it with water in cup or bowl to get the feel of it then you will fall in love with this gadget easy to clean just rinse under the tap the charge holds up just about for job so you don burn or heat up the motor frothing for cup of coffee or creaming eggs for fluffy omelette is easy peasy flimsy for ruff use but hey you can complain for the price your paying this is nice for people who wishes for durable device to blend and whisk their eggs coffee milk etc for luxurious vibe nice as it doesn operate on battery but electric charge feel the price might look steep but otherwise the product is good product and easy to use and it very reasonable price loved this product but it think that they have to increase the capacity of battery power except this all is good it good handy product works well and is easy to use it will definitely make your work in kitchen simpler the product was easy to use and reachable in few minutes useful product very good easy to use excellent value for money nd easy to use,positive
the headband is really thin therefore it starts to hurt after mins of use have wrapped napkin around it for extra cushion but that doesn look good if using outside wish the comfort level was better expected better product from jbl the bass is quite low and has some disturbance also best entry level nc headset with better sound quality nc is not that good but cancels subtle noises and turn down down other noises people talking are not canceled only muted down sound is good for the price range if you are looking for superior nc try to buy sony xm wheb there is an offer which is my next headset to buy the cushions are far too small to fully cover ear they kinda rests on ur ear edges which is kinda painful over long usage there was no sweating issue since the headphone has air holes and provide air circulation to ears charging time was around hour battery life is so perfect like can charge this full and use it for while week without nc with around to hrs of daily usage so final verdict is bang for the bucks if into nc just go buy xm good quality product very good for phone calls the microphone is excellent much better than most bluetooth earphones the audio is clear but the shape of the earbuds fails to direct the audio reliably across different types of ear sizes jbl tried replicating the apple earbud shape does not fit the ear snugly falls off often it good quality product but battery drains very fast anc is just gimmick on this one bass is poor don buy if you need bass quality is good looks nice comfort wise the clamping force is bit tight if you like the cozy feel good for gym or running sound isolation is good earcups are slightly small for over ear would keep touching the edges of your ears you may get used to it or not besides bass the sound is good battery life and connectivity is good too boat has better base and more comfort but they also fit loose these fit tighter overall good product but after month bluetooth not working,neutral

the iron had water still inside it the plastic clips were half opened and the box looked like it was opened the amazon box was intact just that product box was taped up expected to get new product and not renewed item if knew was buying renewed item wouldnt have paid full price good product the product is good but not for steam iron water dripping outside of the iron box wetting the cloth this product is easy to use as no problem of wire and works fine and take more time remove wrinkles is not enough for cordless design quickly looses heat while usage takes time to re heat you often end up waiting for the unit to get reheated corded design is better for range models though this has continuous steam option this drastically reduces the usable time and once you return the unit to base excessive water dripping issues can be noted condensed water flows down the base to the table user manual does not cover all necessary details overall this is not well designed product not happy with real life usage nice product temperature drops down very fast socket of the holding station seems loose sometime need to press down hard on the holding station,neutral

the keyboard and mouse are good for typing and normal use cannot comment about battery life since ve used it only for month sometimes mouse did not respond when laptop got hot while gaming hence not using the set for gaming product is very good but have issues with the packing the outer plastic bag was fine but the amazon packing box brown was broken the product box and the product was fine mouse battery lid is little bit loose otherwise good product is good have got defective product first and have option for replacement and the same day my product was replaced overall the product is smooth and easy to use no caps lock light button it must be there for entering passwords all good except tiny dongle which we loose many times the keyboard is really good the travel is incredible especially when youre coming from an ultrabook keyboard packaging no cover nothing just the box which was literally torn with visible brown cardboard insides yikes good,positive
the led light is vibrant with multiple form selection buildup is too good feels strong and wont get damaged even if it was to fall from table height the battery life is too good if used without leds with leds it will last around to hours only without led more than hours for sure dont expect too much bass and overal sound quality is good for what one is paying justifies he price initially was using jbl go version but surely can say jbl was way too better with bass than this one but obviously jbl wa double the price go for it if want desent sound quality with fancy led lights overall star ps the size is actually larger that what it feels in the pictures it good for home purpose kids to entertain music and light effect but not for party or something like that such best product at this price but little disappointed as in photos and description they said memory card slot is there but when get this product memory card slot was not there but still like this product and specially lighting effect and good bass sound sound is no doubt good bluetooth range is short battery life is not up to the mark led light is too good would have rated it star but sudden night it really made chaos it was uncontrollable not switching off made horrific noise out of the blue kept it outside whole night so that the battery drained out and next day it was functional think that was software glitch anyway it didn appear again for sake good but battery drain pretty fast volume is less nice products,positive
the lint remover actually removes the lint it is not gimmick but an actual working machine it gives new life to the winter clothes which were of no use due to heavy lint all around using this small machine you can remove lint and see the difference used it on clothes and am very happy with the result let me describe the pros and cons pros very easy to use removes any kind of lint it also removes lint that is not visible of the same color which gives rough look to the cloth making it look older so your clothes look bit like the new ones lint is collected in container that is easy to clean cons the process is very very slow you need to move the machine on the cloth surface number of times the build quality is plasticky like cheap toys it may break if fallen on hard surface the cable length is very small the plug comes off the socket easily you need to sit very close to the socket making it bit difficult to use sometimes the lint collector comes off very often the rotor blades make weird noise as if they are going to break the biggest problem is that you need to sit for prolonged periods to make your clothes lint free which strains your neck badly and if you are suffering from cervical then forget it you will use it once and will never touch it again however you can make an arrangement to hang the clothes on wall hanger and remove lint by keeping your neck straight other than that it is good product and can be tried thanks product is good overall working fine but the seller should pack it more carefully as received the upper detachable part in broken condition as it is non replaceable makes it more difficult for the customer but coming to the working part the product quality is good wotks fina and removes everything easily must buy product for winter have used similar product earlier but this one works better and size is also very effective using is very ergonomic and like said does the job well come with small brush to bruah off samll residue on the fabric would recommend buying this delivery and packaging was good too easy to clean easy to use does the job received the product fast and in perfect condition there is leaflet inside promising month warranty if it provides that it teh perfect product for this price this is very product it cleans all lint from my woolen clothes but it have dislike store area is very less and slim it have problem for cleaning store area and the product is very good this is very good life save in winters to remove lint from your costly winter wear have used it on some heavy lint area in my inner wear and its really removed the lints and now can wear my inner again product is so satisfying and easy to use that child can remove lint from his clothes product overall is satisfying expect the the compartment where lint get consolidated it gets loose in every movement product is good and solve the lint problem very effectively so go for it,positive

the main concern is power cord length it is too small overall finish is good functionally it is ok thick piece of bread can be toasted good the only reason bought this product is it country of origin is india as compared to its competitors but they have mentioned it wrong in the description not complaining the product but they should have mentioned correct information book browning settings are done very well rating has been given for this price point well worth the price nice product easy safe nice performance have used of them cleaning up is difficult though toasting up to mark,positive
the material of bigger measuring cups is bit thin so feels like cheaper quality the material of the smaller measuring spoons is thick and good quality the edges of the handles for the cup sizing are way too sharp if you are into regular cooking of variety items go for it good to buy bake cakes for that needed measurements this gave cheaper price with good quality with my purchase good no brainer good product for the purpose involved it is good for price atleast not plastick its steel,positive

fall out of the ears easily even during intense activities the silicone tips are nothing to write home about but that is expected considering the price there is three button inline remote with mic located right below the right earpiece which can be used to answer calls control music playback and trigger the voice assistant on your smartphone the buttons themselves are quite mushy and difficult to distinguish between by touch alone xiaomi mi earphones performance xiaomi claim that the mi earphones feature rd generation balanced damping system that creates transparent sound and metal sound chambers created via step process marketing fluff aside how do the earphones really sound simply put surprisingly decent for earphones that cost less than nice dinner for two while most earphones in this price range have over inflated bass that dominates the rest of the frequency range the bass response on the mi earphones is controlled and restrained it doesn overwhelm the sound signature or smother the highs that said bassheads will be left slightly wanting it surprising to hear that highs are present and distinct in the sound mix although they do get overpowering sometimes the mids are slightly repressed which is evident in vocal heavy genres such as blues while the clarity on offer is decent for the price songs with many layers of instrumentation do sound muffled and noisy this is most evident in complex genres such as rock and metal in which the earphones sound harsh and the mids get buried by the treble and bass this earphone set is fantastic and highly deserving of money used it for while last in and now buying it once more in in my perspective the mi headset has good music and is easy to use good good nice product gentle bass no loud sound product quality is decent don expect heavy music experience it sometime uncomfortable but it fine can adjust seriously if you are bass lover then you can go for it but it built quality is not good it will damage automatically after months it is not suitable for rough uses got it for less than rs not disappointted at all if you compare it with other brands like boat the sound quality isn as good as the contemporaries but for the price paid not disappointed at all the bass is solid noise cancellation is average and the earphones are little low on volume could ve been louder good value for money product for earphones under very good product as expected,positive
the mixier is very asthetically designed and performs well am very much satisfied and would definitely recommend this machine to all potential buyers usability liked this product but one thing is that there is no light indicater of electricity on off so its little bit confusing that wheather it on or off good product the package was not done with amazon packaging but like gunny bag type pack not expected very poorly haphazard packing will any body look into this keep in mind it makes quite noticeable amount of noise and after using it for more than years one of the utensils rotor broke and start making more noise other than that good purchase and good modern design good lid of small jug very loose,positive

the mouse is decent for its price of don usually use windows using this on my linux os and its works fine on arch linux so sure it will work fine on any debian based distro as well first impression the size is bit smaller so it will take time to get used to it the scroll wheel is little wobbly buttons travel of the button is bit too much considering its small form factor will update my review after using it have been searching for this kind of small mouse which is very handy to use value for money just good as in this price range this is nice product in low cost given price better one definitely little one overall good product its easy to use,positive

the only issue is that the built quality is very poor it broke on nd use rest the adhesion is good the product is not sturdy the handle broke after week the adhesive is working but it is too diffuct to peel the tape product is okay but the stick is very delicate so it broke now it very difficult to use the product the handle of the product broke when used it second time so it very poor quality would not recommend its value for money easy to use product of good use wish the handle of the roller was easy to use we have beagle dog so we have extensive use of lint rollers in the household have been using the but its very expensive if you consume to rollers every month so thought of trying this one as though how bad can lint roller be the stickiness of the glue paper was good enough to remove the dog hair but the quality of the handle is really bad it did not even last days so ended up using wooden stick or long pencils for the job if the makers had spent some more on making good handle even if the cost would have been rs higher then it could have been great product especially for those households which have pets as they need it more frequently so might go back to buying the product of look for something in between,neutral
the other reviews say that the volume is too low but it is not at all like that it is pretty good for such small speaker the quality and the volume is very good it is very easy to carry around the people who bought jbl go this is an hands down upgradetion would highly recommend the price is too high but got it in an offer that is the only point the bluetooth connectivity is fast and very reliable and is completely water proof comming to the end it is pretty much good speaker but for people with budget pls try other brands love jbl audio products and used many like earphone and headphones but that all products were brought from official website but this time tried amazon and it still worth and geniune seller and thanks for him and awesome sound more than expected and clarity and bass andvoice is very punch and not disturb your hear but noticed that it have very very lite humms wen it turns on the speaker without pairing but not noticable bass is portable also connectivity is fast charged is late jbl go is actually good but sound quality is not much better according to price over all good delivery aur packaging bhi bhot acha hai battery level indicator not available good audio but the mic feature is not that good good bluetooth speakers by themselves but bit overpriced they re not significant upgrade from the original jbl go have both of them and the sound quality is fairly similar rather the older speakers sometimes sound better,positive
the pendrive is good enough but don have higher expectation from this pendrive it gets heated after when transferring file and the speed also reduces drastically if you are looking for high speed pendrive then this is not for you for normal uses it is good enough can connect to phone as well got it for rs only good product no problem very useful and best for use two in one purpose for transfer data from lap or mobile good purchase just that find the type side doesn fit well in some devices keeps shaking and disconnecting so have to be careful while transferring from such devices easy to use and fast to upload cost is slightly high nice transfer speed for files is good gb onlyavailable total gb and durable is little bad,positive
the pricing is good using is very easy but the product is not too much worth to buy have been using similar coffee percolator for over years now and my old workhorse chinese nova is still capable since it was white and therefore very unappetising sight now needed new one packaging the design of packaging was perfect stiff corrugated sandwich board box foam profiled panels stuck on board for bottom and top board wrapping around the glass kettle the whole unit inside thick ply cover frankly this sort of packaging is more common in high end audio equipment plus for the packaging design size this is small machine and will make about ml of coffee sufficient for mugs in one go if you need larger volume look elsewhere body and finish the plastic body is well made the matte finish looks good the bottom metal plate is seamless and black will have to wait and see when spots appear the kettle is good quality glass and though no branding is present feels thick enough to withstand minor washing bumps the filter bucket and the holder with the flow control spring is ok hopefully the spring and washer which are fixed will last the lid moves smoothly and the hinges and the sprinkler also look sturdy switch is firm function it worked very well on the first use had used an extra coffee filter paper on top of the nylon filter bucket the flow was smooth coffee liquor starts weak and then picks up strength the drip stops well with the removal of the kettle and though the manual cautiously states sec gap for drip stop did not find any leakage on longer removal overall very satisfied with my new coffee maker recommend buying product doesnt work within month easy to use and it turned out better than expected it to be for the price just magnificent saves lot of time the plastic quality for this product is poor it feels like toy had bought amazon basics air fryer it had great build quality comparing to this amazon basics product if you try to find replacement part it costs twice its value its cheap and breakable and the coffee is very very light waste of coffee and also not good flavour nice product and simple to use,positive
the printer is compact and gets the job done no concerns regarding the time taken or the print quality the only markdown for this product is the setup the user manual is brief and doesn explain how to setup the printer wirelessly or by usb we spent good hour having to look through the online manual and you tube videos to understand how this was configured and through trial and error we managed to get it all ready easy to install good print and enough for home usage but installation is quite tedious budget product installation was headache did not know if it was done or not but wireless printing is working somehow gets the job done the printer is good for personal use it working fine till now it easy to use print quality is also good scanning is easy and it image is fine canon product quality is good to say shipment received in time on th sept due to lack of time could test the product recently it is working fine wi fi set up could not perform successfully shall try again shortly other function are working satisfactory only worried is that the cost of its ink cartridges printing photo ar totally not clear pros the best only wifi all in one printer in the range of with ink saver so called low usage required low maintenance thought of buying ink tank but learnt from friends that it suitable for heavy printing and when they didn use it for while repairs needed hence decided to go for inkjet with low cost maintenance this doesn require daily print like ink tanks product is solid built and no issues observed so far many long term reviews also confirmed flawless working for years so decided this model print quality black is very good but colour is average does the job for kids school project purpose easy setup it very easy to setup if you are techy setting up wi fi took little bit of time an hour hate reading manuals and it was first time with printer at home wi fi printing via mobile is breeze with canon selphy app easy photo editor by canon is also quite useful handy cons black is good but colour is pretty average like said good enough for home students purpose not happy with cartidges supplied by canon they seem to fill only half or less for demo purpose it gave around pages for black and pages of color with lowest quality settings where in they claim black and color both cartidges were almost empty and mobile app started showing the same ink cartidges cost yield the cost cartridges seems to be increasing when was purchasing this it was around for black but now it around and had no faith on the yield based on what have got with stock cartidges it not worth buying cartidges so go for refill we only find cl which is small where is cl large size couldn find anywhere online,neutral

the product doesn feel premium would say it good product given the price able to hold all your individual wires and hard disk etc becomes too tight if mobile charger and charging bank are placed keep my small gadgets and cables organized inside my bag could be better if it had more space for at least small boxes adapters etc good product has quite few compartments and can keep lot of stuff has re adjustable brackets in one the sections where items of varrying sizes can be stored has enough pockets to carry multiple pen drives and chargers inner padding is slightly foamy so it does provide decent drop protection if you are tight on budget go for it it does what it is meant for all your wires chargers are in one place you can go for it not that luxurious but at this price it definitely worth having it than loosing your wires good quality of marerial,positive
the product is delivered in st week of feb which is almost the end of winter it is used by my parents ease of use better as compared to many others it has got three level of heating that can be selected by simply rotating the knob of switch some other brands have two separate on off switch for two heating elements to obtain different levels of heating that operation is little difficult to explain to an elderly person over phone improvement required temperature setting mechanism digital display is badly missed currently there is no mechanism to know the temperature which is being set by rotating the temperature setting knob you simply have to guess initially and then wait and do trial and error as the temperature starts increasing slowly it slow process and you can get the right temperature in one go digital display of temperature setting may be added this is general problem didn find digital display in any brand this can easily become differentiating feature this will be particularly very useful for elderly people in today time when electronics is everywhere missing out on implementing digital control of temperature appears to be sheer lack of initiative quick suggestion slightly bigger size is better with oil based heaters works good for me in himachal consumes electricity but get silence no dry eyes comfortable environment buy it if value ur comfort silence otherwise take any other blower which will dry ur eyes throat and create sound liked the fan mode and the amount of heat it generates wrong advertisement only fins for fin oil heater good product value for money,positive

the product is handy and really feels good to hold it supports fast charging it takes around to hours to fully charged it the only down side is that it just has outputs usb and another usb it is good is if you want budget power bank but maximum it last up to charges in apple pro max the charging is super fast the disadvantage is it take so long to get recharged gud product lightweight considering charge but slow charge have fast charging phone and doesn charge fast enough lightweight easy to carry charges fast too overall gud got at discount of rs satisfied it is not fast charging to my mobile one plus nord initial review post month usage charging time more than hours with fast charging power cable power adapter charging phone can charge phone times tested with mah battery leds utter waste so mild that it cannot be seen from distance this power bank truly delivers as mentioned was able to charge my phone times fully with still some charging left in power bank it took around hours to charge my phone completely absolutely amazing product at offered price you can go for this one also tried dual feature charging power bank at same time charging phone and it works well no problem did not face any problem with power bank heating issue while charging phone or itself type charging port for power bank is good so you don have to carry two different cables and type usb cables are hard to find few cons what felt after using charging cable provided along is of no use it does not support fast charging hence used fast charging cable for both charging phone pw bank leds is of no use from few feet distance as they so mild to be seen from distance you will have to hold pb very near to actually see leds although not deal breaker but definitely star deducted due to this bulky very bulky definitely cannot be carried in pocket not deal breaker again this powerbank is the daddy of them all considering the amount of juice packed into it it form factor is manageable it holds whopping ah of charge can reverse charge another powerbank it charged up power bank from in around min while it dropped from led indicators indicating the quartile of charge left in the device is very useful ve not yet had to even once struggle to charge the device as even with heavy usage daily barely drop to before recharge it it retains charge very well too solid buy you literally have generator in your pocket worth for money charging is fast supplied with usb to cable only to cable and adaptor are required to use the another charging discharging port hence additional cable adoptor are to be purchased separately other manufacturers supply along with to cable even with lesser cost,positive

the product is quite small easy to learn and light weight working fine the only sad thing is no warranty card given machine cover also for machine is good the free kit is also good machine is excellent for beginners however the package was missing the sewing kit many people have complained about broken box but for me the entire sewing box is missing little difficult to get bobbin thread out from the machine saree pheeko is task maximum of times saree get stuck in the bobbin area used for basic stitching company has not provided any demo at doorstep as they are not serviceable for few pincodes need to learn on you tube only ok ok product need lot of patience initially for beginners only for the brand name we spent this much better buy cheap one if you are rarely user and beginner amazing product precise stitching and very handy loved it it very useful to all quality good didn get warranty card and fabric is not moving,positive
the product is really good but after written the words in pad it shows very lighter we can able to see well its good for my nephew but price is slightly high for this product one got damaged immediately very good product if screen little bit more brighter over all nice product this product is very good its quality is also very good and it proved to be very useful for children purchased very good product brightness is good writing is smooth easy to use has lock button at behind to restrict unwanted erase but while writing dots apper near by drawn text and lines automatically without touching there so may not suitable for precise calculation and maths like stuff example writing and it may appear as dot automatically appear between or near by them at certain places dots problem more near border and corner same product same package can be seen in much lower price if you google properly my use was just for rough work so didn request for replace or return as seller send from so far via delivery and feel it may be uneconomical for seller to receive and return via delivery service so thinking of seller and understanding their convenience choose to keep and use it human only can help and support human really good quality product very light weight pen is super cool brightness is very high must buy product,neutral
the product is useful and use it daily gave star less because product had small piece broken while delivery maybe but that was not functional part though the material can be bit more thick for durability overall good buy the only issue is stability it do shakes stability should have been better product is very fine in all aspects except in cost cost could have been less very good product in this price nice product good,positive
the product is very good keya are ergonomic after using it for months the keys are starting to get hard let see how it performs in the future for daily use value for money normal typing is good spacebar key is not properly pressed overall good to buy cheap product mean it is not bad keyboard but can get the same keyboard at local store for cheap price without paying for delivery so please consider this before buying after using standard boards like logitech this seems to be with narrow gap between keys have to adjust myself and careful not pressing two keys but it is smooth and without noise may be useful for beginners very economical good keyboard at affordable price good product at this budget but not good for gaming very basic keyboard for typing purposes its waste of money rather go for mechanical keyboard nice,neutral
the product is working fine but at this price range there should be temperature regulator we are always using silicon spatula but the teflon coating is coming off on its own product is functioning with in the described specifications compact good and reasonable easy to use the machine is super easy to operate and use watt is hood enough and works fast as expected happy with the product very good product all and every think is good only cord wire is very short so company have look like to all features and service from bell customer care service can reffer to another person for buy this brand the product is good following cons according to me cord length could be longer the toaster doesnt closed fully which is something that should be mentioned in the product description na,positive
the product is working smoothly with soft slight clicks lookwise is stylish at some extent handy in use portable and flexible product better product at this price range if you are looking similar product at this budget then go for it this is just the initial review at this time the detailed review will post soon depending on the usage and work but at this time recommend this product good justiff its price bought two mouse both of them were delivered on time have been using them for few months now and they are working fine comes with the basis functions built quality is good and you get years warranty which is great for the price ok for normal office use wouldn say great but okay for the price tag overall good for work purposes its very nice mouse giving me above cps and yeah if youre looking for cheap gaming mouse than go for it the build quality is very good and having matt finish got this in and definitely in it works very good the wire is also long enough and if you love wired mouse it is good in not proper size it should be littel big,positive
the product quality is really amazing the wire length is enough and it is sturdy wire it comes with one year warranty which makes it good choice to have quality is good like it very much it is very good product nice one high quality product hd picture was converted to hd quality with better visibility the cable looks and feel very sturdy streaming experience was really good tried mirroring my laptop with the tv screen it works perfectly would really recommend to get this length foot it gives good room space to work with,positive
the product really looks good and classy unless it was not damaged the kettle looks sleek but there seem to be some design defects the base and the bottle dont seem to fit exactly so that the entire contraction wobbles about when the water starts boiling then while pouring hot steam which enters the handle thru the steam sensor hole makes the handle too hot had to tape the handle to insulate my hand from the hot handle the switch doesn fit the slot on the handle perfectly and also noticed some water drops condensing on the inside of the switch on the handle used prestige kettle earlier which had much better workmanship but these are all made in china anyway have nothing against china here with the wipro kettle there seems to have been bad lot which possibly explains why the price is lower than that of other models offered by wipro this is problem with shopping on amazon that one gets sucked into price comparisons and going for the cheaper option which are mostly defective products without any disclaimer in this case consciously went for this option on the hope that it would not be serious defect lets see if my hope is allayed it too good and using it for more than months now nice product to use as simple as the product is good but it makes too much noise while heating it an ok product but price is little high same things same features will gey on some brands at cheaper price lets see how long it till now working perfectly,neutral
the product seems and works good but it not fast charging cable as it has to be and when all the three ports are connected its more slower charging only good is single cable all three ports are there so its ok product only if yiu are looking for fast charging then would say think twice before you buy have been using foe while now this is for sure not fast charging cable and in this tge lightning charger is not working properly every now and then have to check its it charging my phone and had to unplug and reply for charging its getting disconnected don understand how so this cable is no ok used this type most commonly depending on my devices power wats and also etc nice charger charging is bit slow when connect multiple devices cannot transfer data only charging purpose so nice colour cheap and best the cable looks decent with charging but not fit for me as it does not support apple car play,positive
the product was nice its charging awesome cant say anything about durability and sturdiness as the part which gets connected to adapter seems to be in highly vulnerable state with flick of hand it might get bent as my last charging chord got to be so had to buy this one something must be done about that very good worth the money had to replace the cable that had recieved with my laptop opted zoul and am highly satisfied by the cable it durable and works seamlessly this is an amazing product from zoul bought many other cables before from other brands but they didn work that well but this must say is the best of all in terms of charging power durability and sturdiness much recommend ve been using this cable for over months with my galaxy it been working flawlessly fast charging works as expected and the length makes it convenient to use it in bed would recommend to anyone looking for long cable infact my brother purchased one after seeing me buy it the cable has good length charges very fast,positive
the product was received without damaged and seal intact coming on to the product bought the jazzy blue sunburn edition pros battery is good used as opened from the pack it held good for about hours across days and still charge is left sound sensible bass and good mids as well as lows not that can discern between them aux available the ear cups are quite big hence sorta provides passive noise isolation cons not foldable as well as type charger usb micro type being limited edition if your ear cups wear off very miniscule chances of replacing it with suitable color if person is of hot body type emits heat or more warm then normal there is higher chances of feeling warmth in your ears as heard the material just reflects the heat back on to ears that just plain uncomfortable to me also the build feels very flimsy and plastic ky also major drawback felt was that whenever we switch on off we get the built in audio bought it for now after years months today it broke after months of use the red coating started peeling off but device showed no problems sound is clear balanced not very hogh but enough bass good battery backup charges faster aux is available disadvantage is you can fold it planning to buy it again as think this the best in segment now the rate has increased to the first thing want to say is that the headphone is really bulky didn notice the first few days of using but eventually it gives pain on the shoulder if worn for longer period of time hours sound quality is good do not have any bass anc is not present in this headphone it decent headphone for casual purposes if you re music lover or wear your headset for longer period of time then think you should invest in other options which is light weight and have anc in them everything is great about boat products delivered in two days noise cancelling is great bluetooth connectivity is good something it takes time to connect if you planning to buy then this would be great choice in details it was written that it has physical noise isolation feature in it but when it came didn observe as such feature bought it for study purpose that the reason why was looking for such feature but found it as waste of money sometimes sound doesn work you have to decrease the volume to zero and then increase again to hear the sound bu this happens only out of times build quality is good has physical noice isolation soft padded comfortable but bass could be quite better otherwise everything is fine best for gym study online lectures entertainment etc please go for it good quality headphones in over the ear category good quality sound but has less bass as other says but it decent good mic quality for meetings but doesn have any noise cancellation feature just feel that after hours of constant use these earphones feel weighted to the neck,positive
the product will not work with most type of modems it always better to purchase their product have used product for months and it stopped working after that when contacted the customer care they told me that should have purchased there product anyway they have provided the warranty also provided an option to upgrade the product to at discounted rate instead of replacing the current one the product is good will require an additional splitter cable product is very good using since nd dec no issues value for money effective in cutting off and cutting in during an outage normal router can be supported by up to hours on this even after years of use if there is not much power outage recommend to at least switch off power supply couple of times every month and have the battery support this for couple of hours purchased ups works fine with jio fibre and provide good backup but little costly as compare to ups which is not compatible with my jio fibre ordered model for my digisol wifi after installation the product was turning off once the power goes so called resonate customer care and they told as your digisol wifi is not supports and they suggested to buy ups before purchase please call resonate customer care amazing product very helpful at times off power cut this is best to avoid power cut issues pretty decent power backup for home wifi,positive
the quality is not upto mark for the price paid other brands offer good quality earphones with lesser price but per my experience none of my earphones have lasted more than years given that this is jbl lets see how long it lasts can someone build earphone which lasts couple of years ll buy had purchased two units of same headset of which one was found to be defective since was on travel couldn check the items immediately and by time found item to be defective the return replacement window has elapsed build quality is average considering jbl global brand providing an amazing sounding earphone under highly recommended if music lover sound quality is awesome but not bass mic is below average it come out from ears if you walk fast not for game you can hear footsteps of enemy review after use of earphones si year experience awesome product but resolve its tangling issue please otherwise nice product nice after months left side speaker has no bass and not as loud as the right speaker superb voice quality,positive
the quality of coffee maker is excellent dm very ease on making coffee and getting served hot the silver color is much better compared to stainless steel finish lov my coffee made in this this should be advertised as suited for cups not does the job well and even after placing directly on the stove there is no discolouration steel quality is upto mark have been using this product for while and have no complaints makes amazing filter coffee looks and quality are at par with other brands in its price bracket in function this kind of mokapot design is flawed at the cleaning aspect including this particular model in my observation in it the pressured boiling water pushes through the coffee powder in bulk together thus rendering the flavour inferior to what is brewed otherwise when the water percolates little by little secondly the portafilter type coffee powder container positioned just above the boiler chamber sends some dissolved coffee back to the boiler water through the upward pressure pipe rendering the entire remainder water mixed with coffee go waste thirdly the coffee powder container gasketted mesh is sedimented too while filtering the forced brew upward so when person like me thinks of preparing brew in mokapot like mechanism the very thought of the predicament of dismantling the the tiered chambers separating the gasket and then wash the pot thoroughly because coffee is lurking everywhere therein to cause unhygienic residues dampens my desire to go for it am no debater if the idea is to leave the pot just rinsed and washed and not rid it of the residues all this is not the case with the downward filteration method of the other types of coffee machines that are absolutely unmessy no offense meant for any system this is my personal opinion like the convenience of making coffee for people in one go its very easy to clean it up after every use its rust free and looks beautiful while kept on kitchen counter even idly like and good product ordered this for my stay in india it worked the way it should be it has silicone washers easy cleaning product quality can be improved ok product not wow,positive

the scan code is too small for configuration sometimes two way communication has few echo sound which becomes little irritating as the title suggests it good product but could have been better as it is competing with several brands which are known in the market for their other products in night camera won work nned to on extra light for it only work in day time conditions value for money posting this review after using week it is worth buying initially faced difficulties in setting the camera and connection establishment cable length is about feet as it mentioned it rotate perfectly motion detection is also perfect night vision picture quality is average picture quality is good when area is fully illuminated with lights else overall picture quality is good smart tracking works good you can share this device up to total persons two way communication is not so good mobile application is also good but use of pan and tilt option is taking time to take in effect some times camera missed recording of motion and human detection it works only on ghz network ethernet port is given for wired network to operate this camera you must have strong ghz network it does not work well on mobile data network as it laps frequently and taking time to load live and recording if you don have internet than still camera records recording stored in sd card once you connect the internet you can explore recordings from sd card but you can not download for download in mobile you have to subscribe imou protect plan which is expensive without internet it is useless think all above points covered to take decision for go with imou ranger overall works as expected nice good product in price mast,positive
the selfie stick is made up of cheap quality plastic however the built structure of the selfie stick is stable and even the tripod stand will provide you ample support to make video time lapse or portrait selfie recommended to all video bloggers who have just started their channels on you tube or any other sites its worth product with the money we are paying to purchase it did take this product on trip it good but was always afraid whether it going to fell from the stand the holder is clumpsy cannot hold it tighter need another person help to insert the phone in the stand or need to sit down and stretch the phone holder to insert the phone maybe not worth let me know if you have any other doubts it is user friendly product is good and light weight works well and bluetooth connectivity is also good nice product bluetooth option is good stability is ok only otherwise decent product good product,positive
the sequential read speeds for gb video file after reformatting to exfat file system were mbps constant for gb video file note the computer being used for testing has pcie nvme ssd and fairly modern and powerful cpu but machines with decent cpu and an average ssd ought to perform simillarly with usb or above the writes though were different story as in the beginning for about gb the speed was mbps but then it dropped to and it started throttling because of excessive heating difference between the go and the luxe this is where the ultra dual luxe sines as it doesnt throttle much but the normal go does the throttling occurs due to excessive heat generated and because of it plasticky build it is unable to dissapate that heat which can harm the nand flash storage inside it to prevent this it reduces its speed and transfers in chunks of about mb before pausing briefly it is good thing as it prevents damage to the storage component hence increasing lifespan but at the cost of speeds but after mpbs it further drops down to then and becomes stable there here it just too slow for heavy everyday use like transferring videos for editing room temp your milage may vary with different types of files computers and ports but for the vast majority of users who just use it as backup or for once in while storage or for regularly working with small files like pots and photos it perfectly fine its fast makes it convenient to transfer files between phones and laptops and desktops because of it versatile setup of changeable usb and setup it feels strong and durable even through its made if plastic for the price of rs for the gb variant it is not very affordable regular usb pen flash drive and type to adapter combination as illustrated above available for about rs as of writing this review and gb flash drive costing anywhere between and rs as of writing this review will cost less but regular usb drive and the combo will not be as convenient and fast but again it not required for most people not to mention that the adapter is quite useful elsewhere as well but for the small niche of users who want speed and have small files below gb at time to work with it recommend otherwise going with the luxe for performance or the adapter setup better value for money as mentioned above will be better decision hope you find this effort helpful it would be better if the holder of pendrive is strong enough and it very hard to insert into my type mobile lgg got bit scared thinking of it will get broken better to buy this in offer the price gets less than bought got it for pros received product on time with good package nice design portable and easy to use optimum data transfer speed and reasonable pricecons built quality could have been better type is not as easy to plug and unplug it look good with nice finish it is very convenient to use one drawback is plastic is soft it seems fragile compare to metal pendrive plastic material is thin and light weight storage mentioned but it has only gb value for money good product but not so sturdy good very good product,positive
the signal is too unstable once connect you need bit of adjustment by unplugging or moving the wire to get proper signal but does the job go for this if you want to experiment with hdmi as wasn sure it would work for me or not otherwise go for good quality breaded cable good product the cable did not come in box there is no box if this was to be shipped without any packaging or branding same should have been mentioned when we pay for hi quality products we expect certain quality still have no idea if this is hi speed cable or not good bought to connect my cp monitor cctv to mi android tv ok quality at this price give it on reasons as below amazon delivery super fast same day delivery within hours the delivery person was good robust built quality looks feels premium it is working excellent using for lapptop to big screen tv connectivity and could see the undistorted picture and sound nicely doing its work few words of cons feels little hard to adjust and bend as per requirement less flexible but this may not be serious concern overall nice experience so far good job like,positive
the sound quality at this price is unbelievable the colour changing lights at first might be distracting but you get used to it and it works beautifully with both pc and laptop its alright for the price this is good buy small and cute speakers with good sound quality sound quality is really good for this price range great sound quality if only they had an option to disable the lights it gets annoying after some time,positive
the sound quality is amazing but you have to be very careful while using it as the wire from the earplugs to the controller seems very delicate one negative point is that the noise cancellation sucks great bass and noice overall awesome and build quality is very slick it obviously not the best earphone out there but certainly does it job for the price you won miss out on much just bit of bass great buy though value for money decent build quality and looks best product at this price range nice value of the product like this it best quality and good for thi renge,positive
the sound quality is excellent for the price and so are the three buttons however the material quality isn good and the wite breaks after months or so less bass good sound quality might be better like to buy this headphones good product very much like you good sound quality good its really very nice product thank you so much samsung galaxy have tried many wired earphones almost every brand but this is just perfect mids and lows are superb treble and bass are balanced well the remote has buttons mic works well during the call not so good not so bad like but,positive
the sound quality is great all the treble highs and mids are great but the bass is kinda okay okay have bought it two times like this have been using it since january good quality earphones and bass yes bass is also best it awesome like it good the sound is just like other boat eraphones ve tried slightly bass heavy not as balanced as you expect from more expensive brands most people would like it tho pastel blue purple colour looks pretty good,positive
the sound quality of this earphone are really good the bass part was also good only found the noise cancellation was not what expected it could be much better finally can say its good value for money at this purchase did nt received head phone pouch to keep my head phones safe it disappointed me overall good and decent quality am writing this after two months dont use regularly but whenever use my colleagues says that your voice is clear pin that do connect to the phone gets automatically to outside it doesn work plz amazon help me regular customer of this company ll be really thankful to you great sound quality and good bass decent noise cancellation couldn have asked for better earphones at this price best for gaming good nice product,positive
the speaker sound is good and all the other feature are also at the best the only problem is the battery backup it normally about hr but that can be acceptable with this price small but over all good price is too high for this product but sound quality is good it like pocket dynamite loud and good bluetooth speaker tiny like big lemon bluetooth is flaky works for calls but again bluetooth slightly cuts off audio out is ok suggest go for next model up in category but this is good for its price one of the best speaker ever bought it looks small in size but the sound that comes from it is clear and good,positive
the st product got was damaged then request for replacement and their pain strated after days of continuing follow up my product got replaced amazon delivery guys are too rude these days and no wonder customer care will give the generic sop reply but anyways now product got delivered and it good but feel like over expensive colour and quality is average like this product but dislike outer steel makes very very hot after full charged only disappointed with the cord length lovely product sturdy nice color issue is if your house has water filtering holes are big enough ve to dispense leftover water everyday wash the pot before heating in months it stops working and service center almost close in pune so am very frusteted by this product bad service by prestige so never go for this product very good product medium type the fiber or plastic handle becomes hot so does the outer body difficult to handle immediately after heating it is easy to clean cord length is medium but enough to keep the kettle at height above ground when kept vertically in line with electric switch,neutral
the stand quality is decent beacuse of its compact size and various folding angles it widens the usage according to the user highly recommended for students one side is slightly tilted good product good grip sturdy product fullfill the need overall very good product given gift to friends good quality is good built quality good excellent product,positive
the steel quality could have been better but it is adequate the second major problem is that neither the upper nor lower container has handle and so when you try to open them after minutes they are still hot making it difficult for children to operate it the flavour depends on the coffee you use we use genuine south indian chennai made coffee bean powder so the aroma is fantastic but that has nothing to do with this particular product because any authentic filter coffee will have the best aroma can return the product very easily but for such small cost product that doing so would put the supplier in loss due to the cost of the return courier so even though it would be difficult to use without handle won rather buy some better one good quality easy to use and wash is bit expensive for ml capacity rs available with same graded steel very good detailed literature with the product tx my husband used it he can cook much well it was easy for him good product good product to buy if you are far from southern states quality seems to be good till now no unusual stains or withering of enamel filtering action is consistent with design got rusted piece material quality is just upto the mark worth it if the price is under rs size is enough for or cups of coffee very thin steel has been used to make this excellent,positive
the table is good itself and also good grip on floor one drawback is the edges on board are razor sharp and you might hurt yourself hurt myself could be the best in price point just smoothing maybe rounding edges great to have for studies and laptop usage for eating wouldn recommend it slides to one side due to weight of laptop overall it serves it purpose good one does the job but not stable in the bed because it has curve design in four sides if the four sides have grip to support in surface like floor or bed it would have been great product also the water bottle space was annoying because my laptop was big and had less space for the mouse you have mentioned extra height more than other brands tables which is not its the standard size height pretty sturdy table very easy to fold good rubber grip which holds the table on the floor firmly what is really interesting is that it has cup holder and space for keeping tabs or mobile on the desk very handy feature the only con of this table is that it wobbles if you keep it on your bed but that is okay overall great product worth the money easy to fold and has good stability overall good product ordered this for someone and they received the product on time the product was same as described go for it if you re on budget,positive
the vacuum claims to have powerful motor but it struggles to pick up even basic dirt and debris have tried using it on both carpet and hard surfaces with little success additionally the dust collection feature is practically non existent despite multiple uses the dustbin remains almost completely full after each use the lighting feature is also fairly useless as it is not bright enough to be of much use in illuminating the areas being cleaned overall would not recommend the swiss military vc wireless car vacuum cleaner it is poor performer and does not live up to its claims there are much better options available on the market for car vacuum cleaners good good one go for it cleaning suction power as claimed suction power is not very impressive does the job struggle for duct that sticks to the floor visible and easily removed duct is sucked works better than the previous ones bought product seems good but months warranty card not received inside box box was damaged from one side easy to use and friendly,neutral
the video is slight zoomed in which is great for office work since you want it to focus on face rather than the rest of the background however there is slight tinge of sepia warm temperature in the picture quality hence reduced star really cost effective product helped me in my live classes yes this product is an average product picture quality is ok ok and also mike is working ok ok caller listens to your voice normally but its good to use for the office or home for skype calling or zoom meetings the picture quality is crap tbh no mic quick setup no downloads needed built quality no complaints picture quality just near average mic quality ok could be cheaper it is good in daylight if you have window to for sunlight when you use it work better in the night it start lagging you need too much lighting in the night that may harm your eyes and start headache gave bc of pricing but star for camera quality bcz not good in night,neutral
the worst service given by amazon you say it amazon product but after booking many times nobody came for installation quality is good software is not updated you should give updated versions product is super but have some connectivity issues in mirror casting delivery and pickup super but the person who pickup the product dealt rudely with product really like picture and sound quality of sansui led tv would recommend as smart tv and easily installable apps make it completely internet tv picture quality not god very poor quality of stand screw broken with fixing of stand and my wall mount stand missing there totally disappointed with amazon today installation people came and demand rs more for wall mount stand all the smart features like you tube not in this while you tube is mentioned in features picture quality is not so good tv ok but amazon not responded for me for installation work even after many calls and messages and reminders so better to install on our own,neutral
the write speeds are plateauing around mbps and not mbps that is very huge gap in which universe have they tested it it is just okay disappointed by its performence this card offer mbps but it can be achieve only with scandisk card reader other with other card reader it will be near mbps read speed overall product good but screw is only one good quality at this price range exactly fits for canon storage capacity is good speed seems fine good value for money the product is good and fast enough for data transfer of images from camera however the pricing is not friendly it should be lesser compared to extreme pro was using sandisk ultra gb bgt this card for speed but didn see any difference in both the cards no use upgrading card from ultra series card the card is good and one can go with ultra series card dor similar performance at lower cost,positive

there no magic remote and lg should include it by default as it makes life easier the magic remote costs around approximately display when turned on tv and tested the display on black wallpaper found very small green and white dots immediately called up amazon first and then we scheduled tech visit the tech did not come rather spoke on call and asked what the problem and when informed about the problem he said needs to be replaced but no body came with it so waited for days again and nothing was showing up on amazon app about replacement so doubting it called up amazon customer care again and explained everything again and finally spoke to some one and she said she will get it replaced and was given another date within days this time the replacement came and was good amazing picture quality and sound clarity but only drawback is that it did not come with magic remote the television is good but the installation service is pathetic first of all they did not contact us till days after the tv delivery and we got frustrated and call lg customer service and they accepted our problem and send technician after hours and while installing the mount he installed bolts successfully but he broke the last bolt and we asked him will it not cause problem in future he said it wouldn but we don really believe him good very nice good quality best in this price nice choice best deal like lgworth for price very good,positive

this connector has provided as boon for my old samsung lcd monitor and am proactively using that monitor as the nd screen just if the finishing of the product can be improved then it would be better purchase option save it purpose well without any issue am satisfied working fine go for it its works properly good product but poor quality buy this product after so many reviews this product is not so much clear but it get the job done you can buy to get display only not so much clear but still price is very good compare to other products good it worked really well for months but now it started showing its cheap chinese side display keeps disconnecting randomly and will come back it headache to read work on external monitor now since it keeps disconnecting the external monitor and then reconnects it,neutral
this eliminates the need to buy chargers for the new usb charging cables the adapters tend to heat up while charging with samsung fast charger good product value for money it works worth the money value for money its continuously play beep sound while connected to the laptop which is irritating nothing to complain good product but finish could have been still better as of not working fine but doesnt look much durable,positive
this is aesthetically the most appealing digital kitchen scale out of the available choices though it is also by far the most expensive it is value for money considering the followig pros functionality it has only two touch buttons which integrate all the functions like units of weight volume multiple tare weigh with overload indication and off on it can give volume idications for water and milk two of the most frequently used liquids while other liquids can be also measured if glass of water is calibrated for certain volume say ml ad same is marked on the glass the plastic food grade bowl fits snugly on the scale and also doubles up as cover when the scale is not in use duraility because of its squat oblong shape and sure footing the scale wont topple also since bowl fits snugly on the scale upside down when the scale is not being used it prevents dust from entering the display and buttons material is tough plastic with recessed top which seats the bowl firmly and there is no exposed space for ingress of any spilt liquid with all this theres one year warranty extendable to two years which speaks about the confidence of the manufacturers in their own design battery life the device has an auto power off and digital display which consumes very less power hence battery is likely to last longer only encountered two cons scale is very sensitive and takes some time to settle the display backlight goes away after some time and the lcd reading is difficult to read in bright ambient light overall this device serves my purpose of practical diet management very efficiently and effectively and am sure it will grow on me recommended if you want to get much more utility and eficiency at slightly higher price litt to adjust all time ok price wise it didn last long,positive

this is my first product from boult wanted wired earphone and when searched on amazon found boult in such low price and ordered it recieved it today checked it by connecting to my phone and was surprised by the audio quality this is nice product in this price range and the mic is also good the build quality is average and you can complain considering the price it also has clip to attach the earphone to your shirt like the good old nokia days it has total pair or ear tips in zipper packet and already attached to the earphone the manufacturing date is march so it quite new actually not an old stock it also has that anti slip ear hook which is an added advantage in general it is good product for this price was looking for reliable bluetooth earbuds on budget and settled on these personally am pleased with them have been using them for almost four months now including one month when they saw around hours of use per day pros comfortable elegant and sober appearance reasonable battery life would let the earbuds recharge at for example mealtimes decent range going few meters into the next room with concrete wall in between was no issue the battery status of the dock is shown by series of led blinks simple and practical cons mediocre phone calling quality in particular the microphone the few conversations had using these went successfully so this was not deal breaker but the clarity was not the best for sure the touch controls were initially drawback for me but got used to them also this product does not come with charger either charge off of your computer or buy charger with the recommended electrical output as for the sound quality it is acceptable not superlative have listened to music and have watched films and you tube videos with no problem as final note prefer this type of earbud over the in ear type because find it more hygienic wiping with clean cloth after each use and leaving the lid of the dock open for some time should help to slow fungal growth very good product nicely fits in the ear and comfortable the volume seems to be little low at the highest but good buy sound quality is good everything is balanced but bass dominance is too high and couldn hear the treble and other notes very good bass quality and worth for money earphones ever buy also product quality is awesome it doesn fit as snugly in my ears maybe it is cause of greasy ears but the product is good highly recommended bolte audio bass is very good,neutral

this is review is primarily focused on sound quality the term bass is used losely one doesn expect true bass from such small drivers shorter version boat stone very loud loud and somewhat uneven bass mids are bit supressed somewhat muffled midrange decent treble loud bassy speaker nakamichi speck barely louder than the stone mids clearer than bass much much lower than if looking for vfm rule this one out unless this is on big discount and others aren overall fairly even sound at questionable price and volume boat more bass than expected of tiny speaker but lesser than speck and way lesser than excellent midrange and terble much lounder than what you may expect of speaker amazing speaker in tiny package with insufficent bass longer version have had the for years and many have asked me to order it for them it is an excellent tiny satisfying package the midrange vocals and treble is excellent and matches speakers several times it price if bass is not what you are after you are unlikely to find better package even at much higher price point especially if you care for even sound by even sound mean all relevant frequencies produced fairly well no major suppression or enhancement checked the others as usually hear music on semi pro system and the insufficent bass lower mids bothered me nakamichi used to be japanese company making very high end tape decks in the so the benchmarks were high now it is china based company the raised expectations further as said it is barely louder than the stone it is fairly even sound but not significant enough improvement in bass over the if you don care about the money and want something better than the with even sound this could be it the mids and terble are tiny bit better in the speck also has larger battery giving substantially longer backup and better water protection useful if you use yours in the smallest room of the house the stone is miles ahead in bass and loudness if that is what you care for amongst the your choice is simple the bass is uneven however all three speakers have memberanes in the inner shell acting as passive bass radiators one should not expect much nuance in bass from those if thump is what you care for yes it is certainly there for the size with somewhat uncontrolled bass the midrange is compromised somewhat suppressed and somewhat muffled no it is not major and many mgiht not even really notice it much the transiton between mid and lower mids bass isn great one usually doesn expect as much from such speakers but the boat stone set the bar high very high keep the boat stone at an angle such that the drivers speaker are in the direction of your ears it makes the midrange bit better reduces the bass bit but makes the sound more even tough it is impractical to keep it so it makes the sound lot closer to what desire some extras placement of these speakers makes big difference keep them about away from wall ideally corner for enhanced bass and fuller sound if you look at teardown videos you ll notice that the has much bigger magnets than the others it is heavy speaker like that since it keeps it stable and the rubber on the side helps further it is well designed except the and volume buttons should have been interchanged for intuitive use the can also be placed vertically that too changes the sound lesser bass and possibly bit clearer on the whole reduced bass less intrusion into the mids in such speakers speaker characterics change subtly over odd hours of use often quite prominent in the first hour so do not form an opnion before running them in for about an hour conclusion nakamichi speck more even sound than the other two not at all as loud as expected better waterprof rating bigger battery high priced despite chinese buy if you don care for the money volume and are okay wihtout much bass boat stone it is star excellent even sound however the lack of bass as compared to the others pulls it back if you are on budget or if you don care much for bass especially for lectures documentaries or vocal music this is brilliant have used it for long boat heavy loud lots of bass if you can deal with the somewhat and it is not big unevenness and slightly muffled sound it is good package for my needs added the to my equipment list while keeping the ps this was my way of giving back to the community for the numerous reviews have gained from sound its okay to buy sound is not much loud its below my expectations low price awesome sound battery life should be more so cutting down star but overall good gives feeling of home theatre multiple connectivity is also good loved the product,positive
this is the update march want to make huge point to anyone who doesn get good distance may suggest purchasing either of the extension cables because they are what use and they work great fedus usb male to female extension cable or storite pack usb male to female extension cable have my extension cable from the laptop usb port hanging from the tubelight and this increased my bt range to feet radius only my kitchen work area which has walls and feet distance the connection intermittant one plus bullets wireless bass edition reverb red sony wi xb wireless anker sound buds curves jabra elite active tribit quiet plus over ears headphones only the anker has apt connection purchased anker sound buds ak curves and this set has apt when connecting this headset the csr software recognized apt is there difference in sbc apt cant really tell in audio quality but the connection is more stable also have not discovered way to switch between sbc apt like smartphones it automatically connects as apt some headsets may not work properly my brandnew tribit quiet plus headphones did not work well at all it kept running in handsfree mono mode for comparison it sounds like listening to am radio station if you experience the same effect there may be way to fix this before connecting your bt device right click the bt icon click on bluetooth settings click audio video tab you will see scms content protection etc in the dialogue box click the box to enable connect to content protection enabled headset only now hit apply then ok right click bt icon in taskbar add bluetooth device audio video device then search for the bt device now when you connect give it about seconds then once connected it should provide the stereo mode under speaker icon in taskbar once you disconnect depending on any other headset you will have to go back to these settings and disable content protected device for my oneplus bullets wireless have to disable or else they only connect in mono mode very short walkthrough for connecting headset make sure the bt icon is turned on blue color on white off in windows taskbar right click and will bring up table with headings the st is to turn on off the bt radio which is the tplink bt dongle itself bt signal is radio transmission the nd heading is for turning on off discovery transmit receive on off the rd heading is add bluetooth device when you highlight this it will bring up the table which shows phone computer audio video device printer imaging device and keyboard mouse all the th heading is show bluetooth devices devices that are already connected the th heading is bluetooth settings only for tplink bluetooth dongle not onboard bluetooth the th and last heading that mine shows is about this brings up the software provider and vers there is no update option here we have to physically check the tplink website for ub only use audio devices don have any other bt products so am unable to test other than headsets under add heading go to audio video device left click brings up dialogue box to select device to connect with this computer at the bottom right corner click search make sure your headset is on and not connected to any other system home theater smartphone once the device shows up you can sigle click on it then next on bottom of page or you can double click either will connect to the device once it is connected give about to seconds for windows to recognize the connection you will see what the options are in next description in the taskbar click the audio profile speaker icon here there are options that pop up for me note if you only see or then read the section above that says some headsets may not work properly tv sound laptop speakers bluetooth audio renderer stereo and bluetooth hands free audio mono click on bluetooth audio renderer stereo wait few seconds for it to comply now your headset should be connected in watching youtube do get some lag but with different headsets the lag increases or decreases the same with me using vlc or windows media player sometimes if stop the video app and restart then it will be no lag don use zoom teams skype so cannot test how the mic setup would function any one that has any input for this please use any or all of my post and add to it this would be helpful to alot of people first post so for few months was using it strictly thru win utilizing win drivers and bluetooth connection page thru settings system but few times tried to use with music streaming to sony xb or oneplus buds wireless bass edition and there would be intermittant drops also when it came to pairing and connecting it would consistanly slow down my hp amd chipset laptop also anytime took the dongle out it would also affect disconnect my thumbdrive so assumed it was throttling going on with my usb ports have sandisk dual drive wd passport dvi to hdmi and logitech dongle so one by one disconnected everything and left the bt dongle and it was little better so checked the tp link india site for any faq related when searched in the downloads drivers section there was software driver present so downloaded installed it and win taskbar shows bt icon to use the bt dongle the driver software is by csr harmony wireless software stack version once installed there are more options that can be accessed thru the bt icon in taskbar the bt icon sits in the system tray as before audio transmission can be switched between stereo and mono also if your playing video or audio file and you start the pairing process once connected there will be slight pause then it connects to the output in stereo it works really well purchased long usb male to female cable and now have little bit more increase in connection distance have not tried this for transfer of files if and when find need to do so will update for now at this price point it gives me freedom to connect my bt audio gear instead of purchasing more expensive unit to give my laptop bt capabilites and this is as small if not smaller than some thumbdrives oh and also purchased seperate qz powered usb hub for my drives so the only usb devices connected are the dongle and the hub now when disconnect the bt dongle my drives stay connected hope this information is helpful tried not to make it too long but it happened if any questions arise please drop me line and will respond with whatever help can give tp link products usually work well while longevity with continuous use may vary but these devices are not intended for prolonged or continuous use have had multiple to link devices ranging from wifi adapters routers range extenders etc now have tried this bluetooth adapter pros minuscule size you can keep attached to the device not noticeable but not recommended to do so as it usually set to discoverable during setup and it has decent range so if one is too skeptical might lead to security issues although the hacker will have to be in the same house probably range is decent works good in the same room this kind of device is usually meant for local connectivity usually without barriers use it to connect headphones to the pc and it works nicely for that earlier had bluetooth adapter from enter and that worked well too except for the range and bandwidth required nowadays has increased so some choppy audio did occur with today high quality audios and that got managed with this bluetooth adapter nice clean audio lastly it works nicely with linux use debian based ubuntu and its almost plug and play did have blueman bluetooth manager installed from the previous adapter had and when plugged it in didn have to do anything else so unlike what the site says about only windows it definitely works with linux can say if the version ub will work though while installing the driver in windows noticed it was installing csr stack and csr original chip there are many fake ones is known to work with linux so maybe that why it worked well coming to windows have win had bluesoleil pre installed and it worked with it didn have to install any driver separately but there is driver available in their site for xp in win and above it supposed to be plug and play so no issues there now the cons bit high price than rest of the companies probably can improve on that bought it for audio quality is good but somehow compared to my enter bluetooth stack the audio was bit muted had to increase the volume higher to reach the same level of loudness but even then feel slight reduction in the dynamic range of the audio no idea if that software or hardware issue encoding decoding issue it not very noticeable specially of someone doesn have anything to compare with lastly the windows driver is mb granted it has both and versions but each one is almost mb thats way to big for driver of these devices neither bluesoleil blueman cross mb so don know what is being packaged in those drivers also somehow the driver didn have clean install in my system something to do with incorrect loading of library it didn matter as already had another driver installed overall nifty little device have no need for bluetooth as don have any device that requires it just needed adapter to solve the bandwidth problem and that purpose is nicely served and that it works both in win and linux is very helpful does the job well few cons hence one star less using it for weeks just plug it install drivers and you are good to go seem less connection with ps controller latency is very low around ms so basically connection is even faster than wired connection ms but when simultaneously connect airpods gen the sound output was very weak it was muffled but it serves my main purpose with ps controller apparently it seems like its the most relevant bluetooth adapter out there good connectivity and all sort of stuffs like that generally comes in bt adapters say the only con is the installation part it took while figure out which was their website and drivers of ub aside from this everything is fabulous very easy to install connectivity is also good but sometimes while using bluetooth earphones sound cracks also bluetooth sharing is quite slow that all otherwise th product is very good easy to install mean just plug in connectivity is on all point but time feel fumble issues sound quality is all depends on your wireless speaker if you are tight budget it okay then otherwise if can spend extra go for bt version much better in both range and connectivity like,positive
this machine can easily brew coffee for family of members at time some people asked whether this can be used in cafe the answer is simple no reason is that this isn sophisticated machine like professional commercial grade coffee brewer now my experience with this machine was good and bad thing was that did not get the steam pipe sleeve except that everything was well packed when you buy this machine make sure to rinse the internal passage throw the first water from the machine thoroughly wash the caraffe puck filter and measurement spoon remember to never use dishwash gel or soaps to wash carafe puck or anything such it may ruin the coffee aroma method efficient as per my opinion fill the water in tank no need to measure it as it can be controlled with the selector don run it dry it may damage the heating element or pump switch on the machine after that pour the ground coffee powder inside the filter level it and press it to compress use ratio spoon of coffee powder to spoon of water at output before changing over to drip mode open the steam valve and check if sufficient pressure is built placing carafe under the puck slowly move the selector till europa and quickly back it to steam icon this will let the coffee bloom inside after seconds slowly move the selector upto espresso the decoction should be not too slow or not too runny wait till your desired quantity is reached and quickly change the selector to steam mode take milk in tumbler which is slightly larger than the level of milk place the tumbler under the steam pipe such way that the tip should immerse just slight under milk meniscus slowly open the steam valve located at the side steam it as per your need mix the milk and decoction that it remember to not uncap the top lid after usage as there may still be pressure inside open the steam valve and let all the pressure get released coffee used bombay island espresso grind medium roast use only espresso grind or maybe south indian filter grind don use aeropress or any other grind as it may not produce desired taste personally like this machine for the price it good and build quality is moderate please watch some you tube videos if you are new to coffee machines it very very easy to ruin coffee without proper knowledge you may also watch james hoffmann he is world barista champion and shares tips about coffee fan of espresso every time go to coffee joint tend to order doppio double shot espresso but those prices are way too high if wished to drink cup of espresso twice everyday so ve decided to buy this machine one thing to say the quality and durability depends on the user if you take care the machine would take care of your cup of joe so how do you properly clean this thing is the question raised by many guests after seeing always rinse the drip tray use dish washing liquid with water to clean the carafe do not hit the filter basket to drop the used grounds run water over it forcefully to loosen the grounds this is crucial because dents can affect quality before and after your brewing activities make sure that you clean the internals to do this fill the carafe till the mark with bottled water assemble an empty perma filter switch on and set the strength to max in about minute you can see steaming hot water flow into the carafe check its color if it yellow then rinse and repeat if it is white dry everything and switch it off then either do your coffee brewing or assemble it back and call it day always let the steam out when you froth milk immediately wipe off the residual milk with lint free cloth warning never ever use hard tap water it causes serious lime scaling issues which can greatly affect the taste quality of your coffee it may also cause digestive issues always use soft can water the water must not taste salty or sweet take this seriously please do not post misleading reviews stating that my machine broke the steam knob is the worst part of this machine the machine was used just for days then the steam knob decided to loosen up and fall off called the service center they told me to bring it there the problem is just and cant drive and the service center is far away so removed the rubber casket and fixed the knob directly it comes off but think ll use it only to ease the pressure because always drink it black but this issue makes me reduce startips for using the machine use fine grounded coffee use narasu pb or royal elite bold currently using phalada pure sure organic coffee powder for the best results you must grind the coffee on your own if you can make sure the coffee is fresh mind that using instant coffee powder or using coffee mixed with chicory can lead to disaster both for the machine and your stomach respectively you can also go for lavazza but it makes hole in your wallet deeper than the mariana trench only use good quality bottled can water maintain good cleaning discipline in case you ve used hard tap water immediately do descaling refer your instruction manual always tamp your ground in the filter you must apply about pounds of force this is about kg of force hold the force for about seconds and slowly rotate the tamper before removing it make sure the filter lock is up when doing this as you can see this is real espresso maker it produces crema provided that you use fresh and the correct coffee for me it produced about mm crema for double shot this is good for steam driven machine note that this is steam driven machine you can never get the finish of coffee joints because they use dual boilers powered by thermoblock pumps although the tastes would be similar provided you use the correct beans please look at the pics to see the finish the cirrus clouds like crema was from coffee powder week old the brown and rich crema is from that organic coffee powder ve just bought can you notice the finish being directly proportional to the freshness this applies even to taste the white crema cup tasted bit bitter and left bittery taste in my mouth the brown crema cup tasted like coffee at its best leaving crisp and nutty taste also after did some research came to know that an espresso must have three layers bitter crema sweet middle and nutty acidic bottom you must mix these before drinking to have the best shot if you see the glass picture ve attached you can clearly see those layers overall this is great espresso machine for beginner it makes great espresso and it is economical too as said if you treat the machine well the machine would treat your cup of joe well being coffee enthusiast the product fits in my requirement easy to use time taken is reasonable adjustment of intensity works well frothing tool is very good though prefer black coffee frothing helps getting perfect creamy coffee for my guests nice product the coffee strength nob is myth but itne paise me itna is good very happy with the machine works fine and easy to operate unfortunately it wasn packed very well buy the seller so the plastic spoon that came with the machine was broken everything was packed in the original box with only one tape to secure the box it makes the whole process of making coffee more difficult also was shocked to know this is not covered under amazon return policy my bad didn check and now am stuck with this life is no better after you buy this coffee maker delivered without warranty card

this mic sound quality is very good but if you are looking for mic which you will use in your pc then don buy this microphone because it doesn come with trrs to trs converter overall good mic and wire length is also average meter in this price range its very worth it to buy this mic but if you want to use in laptop or pc then buy maono au microphone which comes with converter and it is also very good mic not suitable for dslr camera just good for yt okay product is not good for anyone it is scrap and waste of money not too good it has good sound and audio quality it have not very good in noise cancellation it will filter some minute sound it is helpful for you tube video creators but the clip is very hard so can fit it in shirt it is worth for the cost,neutral
this neat lightweight device responds without delay no waiting with the button pressed and counting seconds before figure is displayed single tap is all it takes to change measurements start up or switch off this sleek beauty can weigh something as light as gm provided the substance is placed directly on the plate great if accuracy and speed are what you need good product good one got on affordable price quality is good definitely would help for planning luggages for overseas travel nice cute scale looks good in kitchen does it job perfectly amazing product with perfect and accurate weights had seen an amazon brand kitchen weighing scale and every time was about to order it was out of stock and now that found this did no hesitate and ordered it for am sure if had waited for some sale period wud have got it for but didnt want to take chance as ive checked the scale the following things are good accuracy tare function light weight ease to use large backlit display stainless steel base what cud have been better hook or hole to hang it on the wall the weighing platform is slightly elevated from the base and possibly debris rubble can stay in between where its slightly difficult to clean with cloth will have to use some kind of small brush overall my recommendation is to blindly go for it and is really worth the price durability is yet to proven which only time aging can prove thanks amazon and seller dont go for or rs product if gonna use it for long run more than month this is the best product to buy it works fine light weight and accurate rs product might show you incorrect reading like gm and doesnt last more than month it is working well good product,positive

this product is good its only customer support and service that is pathetic if not for that this product would have had real good rating received slightly defective piece where indicators where not working initially raised an issue about it but there was no immediate support for that as filter was working fine and we didn require indicators we didn bother to follow up after several days the service guy came and fixed it first time when the service guy came there was no one so he came again and got it fixed for immediate support its better to reach out to local authorised dealer or service as going through the official support delays the process so considering all these feel product is decent free services are limited if we change the filter during the free services we will be charged filter is not free of charge during the free services product is good but the service is worst till experienced if your staying in rural areas and your planing to buy this than will say don prefer because have called minimum times to the custer care they always saying that they will send the service person but even no one is calling you to response if your product is in service period the service person even don lift your call and say the answer once the lady has called me and asked some details after she say it is not come under there area and she will forward it after think five days has been completed and called her back she replied rudely and saying told you this is not come under there area and asked her atleast give me my area service person number she gave me atlast and called the service person and he replied he didn recieve any complaint id so raise complaint on service request then he will come am frustrated and take my product and went to guntur to repair it previously done service with the company servicemen he put cap on the nozzle of the water pump so it stopped working and it all damaged they told me you have to replace the pump it cost around have changed it and decided not to call the service person and write review on amazon so the people will know about the service centre installation guy didnt install propery due to which water was not being purified for last one month poor service from eureka forbes most value for price from aquaguard good ok tap leakage issue,neutral

this review is after month use of the kettel product is good if you need to heat water not milk initially there were no issue in auto cut but last week it stopped working overall in this price range will say yes for this very useful my needs are fulfilled thank you good product product looks good but boiling milk in this kettle burns the base of the kettle it becomes full black and brown and eggs don get boiled in single go nice product after months of usage some issues have come up once it gets to the boiling point it should automatically switch off but it keeps on bubbling till it is switched off manually next is that the water vapors and heat can be felt through the kettle on off switch which believe is dangerous we ordered this trusting prestige to be of high quality but it doesn satisfy the purpose after using only one month kettle on off switch is not working and red light is also not working some times it boiling time is too fast and some times too slow this catle works good but difficult to clean,neutral
this turned out to be the worst mouse ever double clicking within month and scroll wheel scrolling in the reverse direction randomly edit the warranty requires you to take the mouse to their service centre which was pain as it took me while to find the nearest service centre and the address was incorrect the service centre was helpful though as they replaced my mouse in matter of minutes with no hassle will edit based on how the replacement works edit replacement mouse working well so far this mouse feels and looks awesome the slight rubbery texture feels premium and the build quality is also amazing but the clicks seems to be little sensitive for regular use its amazing cant get better but for gaming would want mouse with little sturdier click click heavy during gaming and the mouse may take it but it remains in my head so even for light gaming its fine where use of click is less as compared to fps shooting games it is an awesome upgrade for beginner level gamers just changing mouse can actually improve your experience and gameplay my boyfriend recommended this to me as we play valorant together and my aim was persistently bad even though tried so hard playing with regular bluetooth dell mouse changing from that to this piece was great doing recommended if you re just starting to play anything like csgo valorant or any other first person shooter game on regular basis purchased it on dec and am writing this on dec and ll be honest no other mouse can offer this much quality in this price so if you can buy it just go ahead but but there an alternative mouse by razer almost the same price razer deat ader guess that the name so you better check that one if rgb is not your priority yiu can choose that one bye go for it design is easy to hold and there are extra buttons on right side which find very useful its size is perfect for my hand just one bad thing is after using for some time its surface become smoother or upper layer gets removed good mouse but has poor wire quality its little big but the mouse is giving its best for gaming,positive

this was saviour for me as didnt want to buy expensive stylus and max dont work with iphones its not too precise but it gets the job done love it unexpectedly this product works very well but when buy this the spare disk was missing this item is simple awesome for this price it is doing good without any glitches and worth buying for the price amazon is offering though it is good but the tip of the stylus pen should be umbrella free no handle grips too there is delay between writing and also get wrong color ordered bluse and get gray this is good digital pen for digital art work and very smooth working techniques using so easily works perfectly on samsung plus often use it for video editing too but think it overpriced got it for rs including delivery charges it should cost max upto stars have been cut for overpricing it is definitely worth the money tho it does give some scratches it not that see tho so it fine for it price light weight,neutral

this works by clamping on to ac vent it holds on sturdily minor block on ac flow is not of much consequence the phone clamp is spring loaded and accommodates all phone sizes most holders working on suction does not hold onto glass they fall off while driving could lead to accidents good product but didn work for me as it was unable to hold my moto device weight the clamp mechanism was great loved it but the back clip which goes inside the ac vent was loose and kept on moving also the lock which tightens the back clip was average received today the product is of good build quality it gives feel of premium product not used it so cant say about functinality product is good but fitment in ac vent with mobile phone placed on the holder increases weight which is not desirable good quality in this price range it will however block your ac vent easy to mount and unmount your phone quite sturdy although not perfect has been able to maintain its composure even on bad roads will post the long term review after few months but so far so good good nice product am satisfied with my product,positive
though bought pack of two after seeing the pictures and checking model received only one compatible with my aquasure the other is different and not compatible with my unit so essentially my money for the other is wasted because the return window was over using product regularly easy to install poor quality doesn stay more than month it kinda duplicate it is available in rs in csd but it not available there that why we choose to buy it online but it duplicate and very expensive hence not satisfied give the address where we can buy it offline online also what the warranty of this product mention it good it easy to use installation is difficult if you don or can understand the fitting procedure but once you do okay and super easy important lasts me well over months but recommend changing it after you think the flow of water has slowed down lot or you think the water tastes funny for the last few days of its life the water will not be completely pure and it won completely stop this filter has good water flow rate for family of four it disperses enough water fast within minutes you ll have several liters of water to drink also the main thing about this is it is chemical free it also filters out viruses take look at who recommendation if you fold cloth ten times over and pour water over it it can filter out cholera virus would recommend this to all home owners since got this cartridge delivery didn need to run to the store really liked the product but amazon packing is really made me disappointed really broken trust on amazon filter kits were completely separated from the box cause the external box was too small and made the filter kits squeeze completely just pulled the filter kits to get it normal size please amazon don do this kind of weird packing atleast pack in approximate box not this kind of flat huge box thank you,positive
thought it would be enough to warm room and passage but it heating fan is so small even room heating took hours to warm they have btc but it doesn help to warm quickly it is good product and this month bought pieces the last one looked like used and refurbished heater the wheels provided with the heater are old and worn out they do not rotate smoothly and there is difficulty in moving the heater quality product which will keep you warm not heating well it works but radiation of heat is very low have other radiator heaters like havells venus which hear comparatively much more for same power consumption will not recommend purchasing this surprised from this brand as kenstar is usually good brand used for season good quality the only issue was humidity in room on long usage hours continued power on liked very good in operating easy to use not getting heat kept hr but no luck waste this,neutral

torn packing dekhne me product used lg rha tha bought this color pen set for the first time and absolutely loved it what like the most is how easy is to keep because of the connector the color options are neatly wide and like it would say though it not very smooth of you use it for color filling it does get smudge if you double coat it so there you have to be careful and also you can order just one it has to be two set minimum to be delivered thats the drawback otherwise it good overall eays to use for kids above years simply good the connectors provided help to keep all the pens together these are fine tipped pens and hence can be used for mandala designs just remember not to overlap and colour as this may leave smudge colour pay off is good in this price great product it good for beginners the best part about these are that they can connect so they are easy to carry them good buy for the price during discount not used it yet as it for my niece,positive
totally worth it product is quality is good and beyond expectation in such price range wish company has added other features and some add on in quality and more megapixels to it best buy for students and working professionals but don consider it for buying if you are into content creation and for your organisation my overall rating is out of value for money google meet par chalaya tha photo thik thak aa raha hai used for online examination good product good pic quality image and video call quality improve afterall its hd camera gives better output than laptops original basic camera inbuilt mic quality is nice and noise cancellation working fine paid rs for it on on sep the cam design is streamlined and sophisticated and the plug and play feature is quite useful it was great option at price of in but now there are better options available don fall for good reviews most of them are old be smart you can use the droidcam software to configure your android phone as webcam if you have brief video calls such as an interview or exam lenovo fhd webcam with wide angle vision and stronger mics makes more sense if you want to invest little money spend the money on logitech or if you really want to start live stream or tutorial videos that are more professional you won regret if you already have point and shoot camera or dslr at home get cheap capture card so you can set it up as webcam pros simple plug and play is available the camera offers regular mode and wide angle option the universal clip prevents the robust cam from toppling the green led indicates whether or not the camera is active cons incompatible with bezel less displays the picture and mic quality is poor face recognition is too bad the image will be grainy and noisy seriously no conclusion choose it if there is no better choice available between and it will assist you momentarily you need enough lighting and you shouldn rely on the webcam microphone does the job,positive

update after months of use the tv is still going strong all the good points mentioned in the original review below are still true and very happy with the tv it as if one plus have been listening to their customers after recent firmware updates the issues had mentioned have almost disappeared we can now arrange and move apps you tube netflix as per our wish on the home screen itself am finally able to put you tube first as it is the most used app for my toddler there is no more wifi disconnect issue noted earlier prime video still shows errors sometimes though think that an issue with the app and not the tv strongly recommend this tv original review took leap of faith in purchasing this tv as there were mixed reviews for it however after using it for months the following are my observations good the picture quality is fantastic there is no lag while watching forwarding videos saw youtube review which said its brightness was low compared to other models the brightness is more than you would ever need from tv have never needed to run it on full brightness till now up to works for me for my toddler to watch rhymes set brightness to and even then it is more than needed there were few reviews that said the sound quality was average and you need soundbar disagree have watched movies with up to sound and that is good enough for sqft hall voice command it is quite accurate and am able to change nursery rhymes for my toddler while working in the kitchen which is around feet away being able to control the tv from app is also very useful feature no need to look for remote being able to cast from the app also helps lot it would be even better if everything on phone not just pictures and videos could be cast using the app not so good if the tv goes to sleep screensaver for more than minutes it often gets disconnected from wifi have to restart it againb prime video fails to resume displays error and have to restart the tv againc on the home screen you cannot rearrange apps to have your preferred apps first you can do it in apps window which is useless as you need to navigate to it first easier to navigate to your preferred app in the home screen itself only cons till now got fast moving object looks blurr which was known before buying by other user review but got this tv in ao over all satishfied only minus that too critical is the installation service provider the product is to installed by care installation services provider the installation service provider is total waste and not responded properly actual date of installation was on but was only done by the service provider on the executive who attended the installation is total waste person and don know how to behave to the customer he behaved very rudely the installation service provider is total damage and waste not at all worth awesome quality of pictures and some issues with smart features like in app installation and in connection from smart phone only audio player in work properly but video not show in tv dolby atom video etc good good,positive
update after months update the problem mentioned in the earliest review is becoming more and more dire with time now right earbud gets discharged in hour and half whereas left one keeps going so reducing one star will contact them for replacement and update here update called service center they asked to bring it but am lazy expected they replace at home paid more attention towards the issue above the stable situation is that just after full charge right bud can go upto hrs but left one always goes for mins more and the difference is more if there is standby of day or two when the left one loses juice rapidly it seems so guess can still use the buds but with certain restrictions will happily restore stars if the issue stays stable for next months update after months no change in quality still the pack charges the buds like boss during this period they were once kept in mouth by my infant nephew for over half an hour very dangerous thankfully he couldn swallow them full of saliva and whatnot and on another occasion threw one of my earbuds on the floor with full force undisclosed depressing reason due to which the touch panel with the logo got detached which then re attached after all this buds are still rocking with same sound quality as on day think these are pretty darn sweet deals lack of volume control etc etc is all forgiven happy customer although the issue of left earbud discharging earlier than right persists original review using for last months am an audiophile and also an instrumentalist but hadn used any tws yet so wanted to dip my toes and didn want to invest much but also not something throwaway so settled for boult no boat etc due to their highly adultered sound signature since have previous experience with it like my music flat at studio quality more recently ve been using low cost headphones with mindblowing performance oneodio pro go ahead and search it it is really one of gem for all those purist sound fans coming to this tws connectivity right out of the box only left one was working after connecting to my iphone maybe right one didn pair correctly to left did that reset thing as suggested which also took some effort but after that both started working and since then no issues am using both my phone and laptop linux ofcourse you need to disconnect one to use another but perfect connectivity now can move around in my sqft apt and no connection loss which is great call quality is decent faced no disconnects yet and the other party is also ok with my voice but you cannot talk in hushed voice you always need to speak up in medium volume to let the other party understand you features tapping is oddly sensitive mean it responds even if am adjusting the bud and not touching the central area but surprisingly takes decent tap punch to play pause can get used to that though one thing track aage peeche is ok but these don have anything which can control the volume bummed on that battery decent backup it been nearly months use buds on an average of hours daily and just had to charge the main case just times in an emergency also used it to charge my iphone which it did really quickly was happy to see that one weird thing to notice is that the right earbud always discharges more quickly than the left infact can use the left one mins more that the right but anyways put them both in the case once any one of them starts to complain of low battery sound quality bass frequencies very decent bass surprisingly great low bass songs like the humma song wanna love you sound pretty good but bit lacking in other frequencies of bass lut gaye by jubin doesn sound that punchy as it should for flat signature overall for the most part you should be fine other frequencies ll review this from vantage point of studio quality signature for mids the spectrum is tilted towards bit of high bass but surprising absence of very specific high bass frequencies as mentioned above but its bearable for highs initially felt the presence bit lacking which takes away that warmth and fidelity from few tracks but after using it for few days started feeling alright in that aspect maybe some burn in god knows also remembering that paid just bucks for these mostly will be using these while my walking and workout sessions so think my mind won be nitpicking then ll soon be upgrading though overall really very decent purchase with good sound quality provided you can get these for under cheers hey this one item has built quality is like stone and also the working condition and sound quality it is marvelous but only one problem is the noise cancellation that not working properly which means when we are in crowded area while recording something or call to another person the unwanted noises are coming they cannot hear properly our voice that the only disadvantage on this one right buds not performs well am trying to change music to next but it still plays the same which should not happen according to manual been using these for month now can massively complain the sound quality is decent enough may not be good enough for big music heads not enough bass and provides good noise isolation very impressed by the battery life with the charging case and use it every day if you can snag it on deal for bucks it fantastic deal my only issue is we can change the connection to devices by click every thing else is fine best at price and require some button for operation call pick up rejection function next song play function not working on single touch product is good but battery not as expected,neutral
update as on the power cord has developed twists beyond repair and the seperate cores are now visible the insulation pvc of the cores doesn look very durable don know why such standard manufacturers can provide decent durable cable the iron however is performing flawlessly still disappointed as in coming weeks ll have to change the cable for sure reducing one star for compromising upon the cable quality by such big brand name how it started the need for an iron recently my previous bajaj make dry iron which received as gift from somewhere started giving problems after two years of occasional use with not so careful handling and care initially its wires insulation inside was found rotten around the iron entry point which repaired myself and later its thermostat started giving problems finally its on indication went off and decided that it was time to bid goodbye to it and find new one hence my search for reputed brand make best value for money device began being from electrical engineering background occupation fairly summed up my expectations from the power device as below dry iron vs steam iron this was fairly simple if we consider the explanation that steam iron could perform as dry iron but vice versa was not possible also almost always you find some or the other stubborn wrinkles and crease distortions that is hard for the dry iron to overcome and you need to use water for the purpose on the contrary as the steam loosens the individual fibres of the clothes the steam iron pressing action smooths out wrinkles hence it was better to be equipped with the facility in the first place in the device itself brand reputation warranty as an average consumer we are not wrong in generally assuming that products of bigger established brands have higher quality and perform better rightfully so brand which has been working with product for decades has plenty of experience research regarding the possible points of failures of the product and can be surely trusted upon following the same footprints thought not to take bets upon power devices like iron and go with the super brands like philips having decades of expertise in this field our product comes with two year global warranty which is quite decent in my opinion steam output steam burst vertical steam feature during normal usage with steam delivery of anything above grams min is okay but some ironing jobs such as curtains or quilts require much more supply of steam in such cases the steam burst feature comes in handy users can push button to receive burst of steam when needed more holes in the sole plate add to the effectiveness of steam supplied vertical steam feature in theory can direct clouds of steam in and around vertically hung garments or curtains which eliminates wrinkles without the need for pressing force however in practical scenario and by virtue of its design and water tank limitations steam iron is virtually incapable of addressing the wrinkles like that and hence paying more for such feature is not advised use dedicated garment steamers for that purpose our philips gc comes with variable setting for steam output with continuous delivery of up to grams min which is quite good additionally it can provide steam burst too for stubborn wrinkles vertical steam feature is not available though electrical related features wattage cord thermostat etc the simple maths that more watts means more heat or more steam or quick heating is not as simple as it looks surely more watts means more heat generated but more wattage limits our ability to plug the iron at any socket in the house as for any power above watts would suggest to only plug in to the power sockets going for more power demands must be backed up with careful examination as to whether you really need that much heating if its normal clothes only that you need to iron most of the times surely more heat developed is capable to deliver more steam but that depends upon the number of holes in your sole plate for it to be really effective your water holding tank size and lastly steam delivery settings generating too much steam without delivery can be dangerous as it can pressurize the system last but not the least more power doesnt always mean quick heating as heating of the sole plate depends upon number of factors like the material thickness of the sole plate surface area of the heating element used inside the soleplate etc most of these intricate details are variable in nature and cannot be specifically mentioned by the manufacturer our product comes with decent watts of power good enough for routine casual use along with occasional use on heavier fabrics comes with volts amp max rating of plug is always extra to actual amperage pin top which can be easily plugged into our casual amp sockets as well without any damage to the socket hence enhanced mobility performance the cord length is around meters which is good enough for any practical lengths any more than that would be cumbersome to handle the cord is braided with an insulated cotton sleeve which is useful for twists as well as insulating during cable damage however in due course of use the cord often develops rigid twists turns beneath the cotton braiding which is hard to straighten out so not so great on the cable quality terms the cable only comes with degrees of swivel movement which is quite disappointing and would have really wished if it was degrees of cord freedom the thermostat knob for temperature selection comes with regular settings but going with reputed brand like philips always assures of good quality of thermostat after all the thermostat is the heart and soul of modern day irons and must be highly durable and reliable lastly our product is an isi marked product which is quite an assurance for sure soleplate material shape this is probably the toughest part where each company claims to have the best and easy gliding soleplates variety of soleplates are available in the market today like non stick teflon coated aluminium plates with american heritage coating steel plates with alloys or ceramic coated each has its pros and cons teflon coated plates are easy to get scratched and gather dirt over period of time american heritage is similar to teflon and glides over the fabric even better stainless steel is the most durable and easy to clean however may stick to clothes on higher settings adds weight to the device metal works better than ceramic for pressing in sharp creases on sleeves and trousers good for smooth gliding and even heat distribution but biggest advantage is to eliminate static charge at high temperatures which may cause clothes to stick when ironing on synthetics and fabrics blended with spandex ceramic iron will suit your needs best as ceramic does not stick to these fabrics but the coating may peel off on rough handling aluminium soleplates heat up quickly but are prone to damage and may stick to clothes our product comes with linished soleplate which is quite inadequate detail as linishing is process of grinding or polishing surface to make it perfect flat however apart from linishing stuff can surely say that the soleplate in our device is decent gliding but not the best gliding its heavy but doesnt stick to the clothes yet for that matter trusted the brand reputation and went ahead with this linished soleplate stay away from teflon coated ones though as its bound to wear off fast regarding the shape honestly wanted it to look like american fighter planes with sharp beak design and dark colors lol however those models with my looks were weak in overall specs so had to settle down with this still decent looking model features like anti drip anti calc grip to tell you the truth these are more of fancy terms rather than actual purpose for most of the users presence of these features isnt problem though as in areas where the water comes hard anti calc may stir and clear the calcium build up if any in the water tank however if you use proper water drain it out timely do not fully fill the tank allow it to heat before using steam follow all procedures correctly you wont actually need to use these features regarding grip many iron nowadays have some unique design which is set ergonomically to give better grip our product comes with the anti calc function and is decent to grip though think not ergonomically still nothing for deal breaker and these are minor features to discuss upon price vs performance even though did not have any preset price tag in my mind but still going over would have definitely felt extreme for thing that dont make use of that much bought it at price of around bucks for all the features and performance it delivers think it is worth it final verdict all in all would just say that even though our product might not have the best appealing looks or the best soleplate or the best burst of steam or the best swivel of the cord still what it has is complete package of all the individual features clubbed together in decent right performing way which is hard to come by in an individual model got this one on demand from mother for few days she was insisting on buying one iron for daily chores was already researching iron for one of my friends so this search did not last long deven earlier philips was the only name that came to my mind due to its consistency product quality also had bajaj usha morphy in the list but trust in philips did not let me go for any other brand got this iron well in one piece and without any scratches on the soleplate inside boxsteam iron inside poly pack instruction leaflet warranty card aboutwattage watt weight kg water capacity ml cord length meter indicator on off based on temperature setting max water level marking warranty years pros good quality iron with effective ironing steaming body is solid with good finish overall at this range linished teflon coated soleplate for easy gliding on all fabrics gliding is somewhat limited in steam mode due to moisture sufficiently long cable with swivel joint at iron for easy movement and usage capacity of the water tank is sufficient for average steaming operation min or more in one fill spray function is well designed it evenly sprays water and not just throws fine jet of water the spray function produces fine mist that evenly moistens the fabric making it easier to iron out tough creases wattage is sufficient enough for home usage and can easily cover tough wrinkles and heavy clothes easy and fast filling of the tank owing to the huge filling hole easy and complete emptying of the water tank owing to the large hole and the sideways opening door weight on the ok side not lightweight but not even heavyweight some weight is useful as it helps ironing by applying pressure on the cloth empty iron is lightweight only cons steam control knob looks loose at first but it works well in the long run water movement during iron creates jerks and affects smooth operation but that the way it will work you can do anything for regular lightweight iron users it will appear bulky at first but you get used to it in few days no steam burst function in this model gc but you get what you pay for cons are temporary and don affect functionality in the long run so device buttons knobsspray button push to spray steam knob off no steam low less steam high high steam calc clean mode calcium deposit cleaning more below temperature dial rotate to set temperature cutoff for different fabric types linen cotton woolen silk etc usage guide keep knob dial in off position fill the tank to the max level if planning to use steam function connect to mains set the temperature control knob to the required position let it warm up until the indicator goes off now operate steam knob to low or high steam enjoy ironing or steaming without interruption till water lasts use water spray function as required usage tips use ro filtered water if possible as it low in hardness and will ensure the longevity of iron without choking the vents or orifices let the iron heat properly before use leakage has been observed if one uses the iron without heating properly as water will directly pass from vents without getting converted to steam gently clean soleplate and don use any hard material or chemicals emptying water tank every time after usage is recommended to avoid scaling problem as calcium deposits are more in standing water untangle straighten the cord once after every use before storage as these cords tend to develop sharp irrecoverable turns over time and those are hot zones for cable failure when not using steam function keep the steam knob in off position use calc clean mode once in weeks if using normal tap water with medium hardness if water is very hard increase the frequency or if using ro water decrease frequency once in few months clean steam control needle using vinegar to remove the needle rotate the knob to calc clean mode and gently pull it out last but most important use properly earthed wall socket for iron to avoid shocks calc cleaning modethis iron has calc cleaning mode to descale it to do so follow the steps below keep knob in the steam off position fill tank to max level rotate temperature dial to max position and wait for the indicator to go off take out socket from mains and move iron to sink turn the steam knob to calc clean position and pull it up few cms let all water be used up steam and hot water come out along with calcium deposits the principle behind this function is sudden change in temperatures of inside zone which leads to contraction expansion resulting in scaling shredding and flush out clarification damage to body or plate other issues concerns raised by other users several users posted about the damaged product or soleplate on arrival and other usage issues let me put my insights into those had no issue with the quality of the product delivered it arrived in proper condition without any damage anywhere as proper care was taken for this using air cushions maybe their seller was careless enough and that resulted in damage during transit soleplate had no marks on it yes here philips can provide protective sticker or film on the plate which will reduce the ratio of complaints for the damaged sole plate on arrival temperature dial works properly and markings are intact after months of usage slight difference in color tone maybe there across different zones as different materials are used as per requirement say hot zone near plate vs cold zone at back leakage will be there if the steam knob is in steam position and iron is not sufficiently hot to convert incoming water so it passed directly appears as leakage philips has explicitly mentioned this in product details remember to order it from reputed seller check seller ratings reviews and amazon verified tag to avoid any issues like the faulty product duplicate product etc don get confused there no steam burst mode here some of the photos displayed are with steam burst function symbol on the button even some users have mentioned this in their reviews but it is not present in this model models with the said function have two buttons for spray burst instead of one here for spray only also steam output at one place is min another place min its actually min final verdict if you are looking for good quality durable steaming iron in the range philips is the name you should seek for this model of philips has got good build quality features which are more than enough for an average home user so at any point you can go for this model if on lower budget range you can go for philips gc or bajaj mx but both are low power and philips one misses steam spray function too but still both will cover most of the usage pattern of home user heavy users may go for philips easy speed plus gc or black decker bd bxir in or morphy richards super glide in range note unlike regular lightweight irons steam irons generally don go easy with repairs unlike regular iron if the coil is damaged in the steam iron whole of the bottom plate needs to be replaced if you are out of warranty it will cost you lot in fact for the cost of the plate plus few bucks you get new iron so check your requirement for regular vs steam iron choose wisely tried removing hard wrinkles of jeans but it couldnt remove them properly they were still visible even after using the steam easyto use but it leaks water very good its good product iron is good and the best delivery with few hours just this iron doesn have stream burst rest is good simple cloth iron,positive
update it been months since first got boat rockerz some of the dislikes ve mentioned earlier in my review are no more dislikes said the sound is more or less on flatter side but quite used to it and loving it the second point is said if you are an audiophile then you may not like it but was wrong you might ask why here is why after long gap visited my father who is an audiophile he has numerous high end headphones but unfortunately he got the attention of my headphone and he just wanted to try it said yes regret it he paired it with his device and played song boy you got to see the grin on his face he said keeping it you buy another one poor me was forced to buy another one few days back got another one one thing noticed in two of my purchase is the audio cable is no good both my audio cable had the same issue so the moral of the story is hide it from your audiophile dad or brother they will unceremoniously snatch it from you jokes apart people you can go wrong with this purchase it worth every square inch happy shopping end of update got this product days back and got it for rs lightning deal of course this is an honest unbiased review keeping in mind the price of the product three days might not be sufficient time to review this product but sorry can help the excitement likes good built quality it is sturdy for the price the build quality is great it is not flimsy the ear cushions are good enough sound quality if you are an audiophile this is not for you bass is decent nothing to go overboard as noticed in other reviews bass is deep enough for the price connectivity pairing is easy connects like breeze dual mode wired and wireless boat rockerz comes with an aux cable if you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as wired headphone couldn find substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though absolutely loved this feature battery backup impressed with the battery backup of this beast ve been using it for days for hrs day still its running so guess the hr backup per charge is not marketing gimmick presume it true so far so good will update it after month usage dislikes sound quality is more on the flatter side when you compare it with budget wired headphones like sennheiser cx street ii bass is not too deep you won get that ambiance boat website says don just be loud be loud and clear nope sorry ve to disappoint you on this when it loud it not at all clear lot of distortions are there when you are loud comfort believe me it not at all comfortable for prolonged usage your ear will beg you to take it off after mins if you have high fortitude you can push it till hrs if you could go more than that without taking it off for minute then you are superhuman range boats says meters range in my experience if you go beyond meters then the voice will break you will never ever get mtrs range trust me on that and experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but don know whether it will be problem down the line will let you guys know about it later if it problem flimsy aux cable can complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind remember paid only for it but with certain devices the aux was not working properly mi note had issues mi also had issues with aux not sure whether it the problem with my device but it worked flawlessly on my laptop wafer thin service centers boat gives yr warranty but what good is it if you can find any service centers near you this is hit or miss guys voice cancellation didn find this effective maybe it just me not sure microphone is pretty much useless you can make calls with this headset some alternatives these are all wired headphones comparing them with wireless may not be good idea but still compare it with them because boat rockerz comes with an aux cable and if you are looking for an alternative irrespective of wired or wireless it might be of some use to you sennheiser cx street ii don think boat can beat this one quality the sound is incomparable the base is deep nice fidelity nice ambiance and for price of this is unbeatable budget wired in ear headphone own of this beauty total value for money if you are an audiophile and are on tight budget then can better alternative than this sound magic in ear headphones with mic black gold this is another tvfm earphone sony extra bass mdr xb on ear headphones don buy it if you are an audiophile obviously audiophiles will go only for wired headphones if you intend to use it for long hours buy it if you are looking for budget wireless headphone with decent built quality and performance if you require wired and wireless package in one verdict give this headphone score of if you are on budget and you want to enjoy hassle free bluetooth headphone with good performance then close your eyes and buy this beast trust me you won regret it you won be disappointed in this price range couldn find any other headphone with such performance we don have many options do we pthe actual price is rs and amazon claim they are giving discount pls don fall for that would not recommend paying more than rupees for this headphone note not an expert in this field this is just lay man review thank you for reading the review and hope this will help you with your purchase decision my boat wired in ears were giving out after hard use and wanted new pair of headphones and wanted them to be over the head types like this one also wanted one with both aux and bluetooth options since would be using it for the tv laptop and my phone have fumbled with this strata of the headphone market previously and after buying good for nothing ones from motorola chanced upon this value for money good bass nice sound quality good build but not premium if you can get it below rs then it is very good deal its difficult to let go of my boat headphones bought this on for price on sale the bluetooth was working fine but it went off after an year know this would happen and thats when the legendary aux cable comes in ive been using it with the aux cable for almost years again but later the top headphone band broke off used fevistick to stick it up and used it stretched it even further but it broke again but there is no difference in soundquality what so ever so far its been soldi years since usage of this product still trying to stretch it further if it doesnt work may hvae to say good by to this beast of product and its sad to note that the current boat products on offer fail to deliver this robust quality they ve become the company that focuses on quantity over quality nowadays evolutions aside gotta respect this product for what it has given me so far genuinely reviewed after years and it still working but once head strip was broke fixed it by using you tube video overall it very good purchase for me dont think about specs you can blindly buy because it worth it recently purchased the bo at rockerz bluetooth headphones they have great sound quality and the soft padded ear cushions are very comfortable the battery life is also impressive with up to hours of playback overall very happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone looking for good pair of bluetooth headphones under rs it is best head phone sound quality super bass good noise cancelation not bad product weight not heavy nice headphone nhi bole to jhakas sound quality is very good and bass is also good but was expecting more like theatre bass but not like that hhh laalach karna buri chijh hum sudhrenge nhi kabhi think bored sum of this headphone mast hai enjoying good quality easily connected my lg smart tv,positive
update now after this review they have told me to give them atleast star review just to even consider arranging for the replacement not even guaranteed now lets see if they actually do as promised original review after months it stopped working so raised request for it but have to courier it to them cost rs then they found that it was problem with the pcb they changed it ok good but they replaced it with the pcb of pro bass which is an older and lower priced model when shared them the screenshots and asked them for an explaination they just asked it to be couriered back paying for their mistake no reimbursment no quality suppport no resposnse to emails apart from the standard script one of the most regretted purchase the product is looking good but not good sound quality and then packaging is very poor think people open the product when it is packaged for that the package is cut and things are different think that these companies make people think little spare eartips were missing from the package received so that was disappointing sound quality is good for the price enc is decent the eartips are excellently designed so the earphones fit well you can run without any issues it doesn feel stuffy into the ear already have bose qc and sennheiser bt headset but was looking for light neckband headphones for the convenience it offers and am really satisfied with this good buy over all would recommend to go for it connecting only one device getting off after minute whats app incoming call not working proper caller couldn hear receiver voice have issue in this product one side is not working so please look into this good good,neutral
update returned the drive with money reverted back seller was cooperative reverted without hassle or communication about the brand sandisk san disk is an israeli american manufacturer of flash memory products including memory cards and readers usb flash drives and solid state drives as of february it is the third largest manufacturer of flash memory san disk was founded in by eli harari sanjay mehrotra and jack yuan with sanjay mehrotra being the president the ceo on may san disk was acquired by hard drive manufacturer western digital in us billion deal why dual drive why gb why sandisk before we proceed with the muscle merits or the key features of the device lets have quick look upon my personal selection process dual drive apart from my need for basic pen drive with sufficient storage chose to go with dual drive that could work with my mobile devices to offload it of the memory burdens and play some stored media at instant whenever desire crosses over could have gone with basic pendrive with usb to otg adaptor cable but then realized in todays comfort seeking world whos will keep track for the tiny adaptor cable or moreover take the trouble every time to fetch it then fit it in event of sudden mood swing for any mobile media requirement gb this capacity seemed to offer decent compromise between storage price future proofing as with modern mobile cameras photos and videos shot are mostly of high resolution and larger size gb ensures that you wont have to empty it out any sooner or on regular basis sandisk in the recent few years sandisk after becoming western digital brand has witnessed tremendous growth in market capitalization quality and brand image offers the best value for money deals for an average usage moreover could not find much reputed brands in the storage with otg feature note speed enthusiasts though should refrain from this version should try its designated speedier extreme versions or other brands like transcend samsung about our product the device comes with the title san disk ultra dual drive and is the newer version of its previous iteration here need to quote that the term ultra came quite as surprise to me as found nothing in lines with common understanding of ultra we will discuss it in detail in upcoming columns of speed with micro usb connector on one end and usb connector on the other the drive lets you move content easily between your android phones tablets with micro usb ports only or laptops both the connectors are carved out of metal the usb connector is backward compatible with usb ports size the size of the usb is quite small which can be good for easy storage in your pockets but might be tedious to find if misplaced the usb fares around an inch in perfect closed condition and inches when expanded at usb end construction the device has plastic body the overall construction of the drive is just average the retractable plastic column seems to the weakest link of all and would surely break if you accidentally step over it however the actual drive storage portion is built of rigid plastic and wont give up so easily both the usb ports are built of metal which again is quite relief fit finish being equipped with retractable mechanism being too small the drive is not so smooth to use slide in or out in single shot and needs some getting used to but then most of the otg drives are designed small and hence have some or the other odd way of conserving size the usb ports fit comfortably in devices and pulling it out too is fairly easy storage format since the previous fat version had limitation of file transfer size of maximum of gb for single file ntfs was not compatible with mac os so with increasing file sizes ex fat format was devised which doesnt have size limitation like fat yet is compatible with mac as well so our drive has only ex fat ntfs formats to choose comes in ex fat by default with kb file allocation size increasing the file allocation size may increase the transfer speeds little but will affect the storage capacity little too changing it from to kb increased my write speeds from mb to mb if thats relief to anyone the format would surely work well with most of the tvs tablets and mobiles though check it with the car audio head unit and try to change to ntfs if it doesnt work speed the de merit detail have been flagship gadgets freak all my life preliminary to my purchase had doubts regarding its speed as quoted by fellow buyers but then did not have speed in my mind as primary motive for this there were not many options for dual otg device so took leap of faith and went ahead with purchase my basic intent was to load bulk movies from my laptop into it and watch it over my tv or mobile however when was transferring movies of total size gb it started showing minutes which kept on getting higher it felt like waiting forever for it to happen even for single movie of gb it took minutes sec by stopwatch to transfer the write speeds started with mb sec and went down down to mb sec even with my older kingston dt elite gb the write speeds were in excess of mb sec admit have usb port at my laptop yet was never used to such low speeds ever the tagline ultra and mentioned speeds of mb sec which suppose is the rated max speeds at usb ports felt like dream and beyond exaggeration finally with every passing minute it became all the more unbearable and annoying even in ntfs format speeds were the same had never expected it to be this slow in this modern era of thus finally decided to return it but suppose will only get replacement not reversal know that read write speeds depend upon lot of factors including transferred file type format configuration of drive configuration of host destination device etc benchmark crystal disk mark scores for file transfer of mb size were mb read mb write which looked like mere consolation transfer between my samsung mobile tablet too was not fast verdict yes my friends all other reviews about this being slow to the point of being unbearable are absolutely right and maybe san disk should retag it as ultra slow storage out of the total name plate rating of gb the actual allocated space for usage is around gb which is ok enough warranty the product comes with year limited warranty which is one of the segment best offers price bought the device for bucks which was reasonable to me given the storage size dual drive brand image mrp over the pack was printed bucks it was tagged made in malaysia only if it was bit faster final verdict all in all in my personal opinion given the brand image ultra tagline modern day technology advancements even if you try to be too generous or lenient upon the transfer speeds yet its hard to spare such low read write rates even for routine tasks it will keep on reminding you of the compromise you made for full price it could have been great all rounder device coupled with the good brand reputation of sandisk years of warranty had its speed been any better covered here actual storage space heating mobile phones tight fitting on mobile phones speed formatting file system value for money free app company brand seller about company product seller san disk ultra is brand of western digital which is the same company that sells external hard disk storage devices under the brand wd elements and wd portable about to years ago wd elements portable drives of tb and tb were priced rs less than current day prices they were sold by cloudtail seller on amazon now san disk and wd drives are sold by appario retail seller on amazon for best prices on san disk and wd products in india the current seller has the lowest prices for authentic brand new products reason for higher prices for same brand same capacity storage devices may be various such as import duties taxes manufacturing costs higher demand for the brand etc review san disk ultra dual gb usb otg pen drive gold storage space just as in external hard disk drives the actual usable storage space will be less than what is mentioned on the product same as others for the gb pen drive actual storage space available is gb this is normal and not some fraud or fake advertisement this is because it has fat file system also the device uses some space for its functionality and use in linux os laptop the available storage space on this fat pen drive is shown to be gb so that gb more than what windows os calculates using their ntfs file system heating even with just minutes of use you can touch and feel that the metal part of the pen drive is getting heated but the performance of the drive has not got affected by the heat this heating does not happen in wd external hard disks and seems to be unique to small pen drives of various brands mobile phones the pen drive works with android os of mi phones such as redmi note running android including old android version as well too tight for phones the pen drive is tight fit on mobile phones tablets so be careful when pulling it out so as to not damage your phone because this is also the charging point for your phone if you feel that your phone is too tight for this pen drive then it is best not to use it for phone data storage management value for money even if you don use this pen drive for mobile phone it is still the best price for gb pen drive with usb backward compatible with older usb ports on older laptops and computers speed the speed is extremely good for windows os laptop linux os laptop and android mobile phones file system formatting the pen drive unless you are sure you won use your pen drive on particular device don format the pen drive to change its fat file system but for example if you have decided that you won use it on mobile phones or tablets because the fitting is too tight and you don want to risk damage to this point which is primarily used for charging then go ahead and format the pen drive for your laptop with ntfs formatting you will see an increase in available storage space in your pen drive with your linux system file format you will have better storage space than any windows file system beware that if the pen drive has ntfs file system then it won work with mobile phones tablets laptops which don have windows operating system same way if you format the pen drive for linux os file system it won be recognised on windows laptops android phones tablets etc if like most people you will be using this pen drive on laptops or other devices of friends or co workers then leave the existing fat file system as it is free app memory zone app for android is bundled free in this pen drive it is easy to install and doesn take any phone permissions other than storage access it is very useful app with easy user interface app takes mb storage space on android phones features include cleaning junk files that you may not otherwise know through your phone file manager app enable or disable automatic backup to your pen drive add cloud storage such as google drive or microsoft one drive and add micro sd card storage to manage all your files from just one memory zone app restore backup copy move delete files as well as clean up whats app related files see available storage space on your phone see data sorted into photos videos music documents beware users of memory zone app should know that they agree to terms of use which include that if some government agency requests the company for information against piracy such as illegal copy storage distribution of movies music software books etc as per dmca copyright laws then the company will provide the user data to the government investigating agency to protect the intellectual property of content owners overall best product in the market at best price in indian market with features not

update sept bo at seems to have heard the feedback and updated the watch faces now there are few good ones to pick but slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had bit impressed added one star for it not very polished product the fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text the watch faces are lazy design job no point having watch faces if only are good or usable rest are useless update oct bo at seems to be on smartwatch launch spree and thanks to that they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from so overall still the smartwatch ui needs work but atleast you have good watch faces good screen quality battery life looks and the metallic frame call clarity bt calling at the price reasonably accurate sensors bad the ui fonts they are all very ugly and tacky they could have tried to give the chinese software some makeover but it is clearly lazy job by the tech team copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for min or so watch faces again job of the design tech ui team bo at doesn have good team of designers and ui guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch ui no option to silence call or reply with quick replies look for noise smart watches in the same range noise colorfit pulse go buzz is cheaper and better alternative has better watch faces and ui and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed you can go for bo at wave call also it isn an outright bad watch but there are better options available for the price bo at if you have team who reads and wants to improve get some good ui and design folks in your team your products are good but the ui and design is what the people see and that what makes them feel good about your products you have really average ui boat wave call watch is best for budget call is too good and sound quality is also too good battery is good totally the watch is good for range it good value for money smart watch light weight touch is smooth all the features are accurate good product in this price range must buy it good lookinggood quality good product is mst average for calling good looking really happy to purchase this watch it very affordable having so many features the calling feature works really well overall if you re looking so good brand good features go for this product does not turn on please return the item please,neutral
updated overall you really get what you pay for they serve the purpose of decent pair of tws for basic quality calls and music listening main problem noticed was with the pairing and connection strength as they routinely lose signal for no apparent reason once or twice had issue of only one of the buds getting paired and had to reset the other one to get it paired if you have paired these to one device and try to pair to another one without disconnecting from first it simply doesn work this is starting to get annoying but maybe ll get used to it we ll see this is just day review of these got them for rs on some offer on amazon ll post updates later on hope this is helpful for anyone interested package the packaging is quite decent for such low price comes with the tws earphones fitted with medium earplugs fitted inside the case also included are very short usb cable and two additional earplugs small and large package includes some noise stickers and pretty good user manual and warranty instruction card build was immediately dissapointed with the plastic case as the lid was rattling and not confidence boosting will use it for while to see if my worries are unfounded the earphones themselves are rather sturdy feeling in hand they fit very snuggly into the case and there is no evident feel of them coming lose or rattling within the case comfort this is very subjective and each ear is different it one of the reaonss wanted to get cheap tws to see if ok with the form factor for long hours the prefitted medium size earplugs were not comfortable so switched to the small size ones and after about mins forgot was even wearing them the earbuds are very lightweight owing to the plastic build but upside is that they don cause any strain even after an hour of continuous use one thing to note is that if you have gandhi ears then the fit might be little awkward should know my ears covered the touch areas of the buds so had to fiddle around bit if wanted to do any of the touch actions ymmv sound quality liked them no audiophile but they have decent volume and satisfactory levels of bass and separation tried my usual test at and they fared quite well the treble maxes out at khz post which you hear nothing at all but this is to be expected at the price point there was noticeable vibrations creeping in at below hz but the and drivers seem to be matched well and all of the panning tests were quite decent feel this definitely punches above its price point call quality in low to no outside noise environment the microphones were very good there was no lag and the person on the other side said my voice was very clear but things take steep fall as soon as little noise is present and you start sounding like you re inside well seems the mics can figure out how to filter out your voice so they end up trashing the call quality overall you get what you pay for here range max got was around not sure how they tested and got as advertised any disruptions like wall will simply break the connection but they connected back automatically every time so far so guess that passable pairing update on th aug major issue here is that if already paired to device like laptop they simply are unable to be paired to another device like your phone you have to unpair from the first device and then try to pair again had issues like only one of the buds pairing as well have to fiddle around to get it to work and is not convenient don have phone to test the fast pair features actually not even sure these support it anyway the earphones go into pairing mode as soon as you remove them from the case and was able to pair with no problems on multiple phones they will auto pair post this initial setup to previously paired devices could not find any way to control the pairing mode though you have to live with what it comes with as there is no app or anything to control what it does they switch off pairing mode once you put them in the case so hopefully that means the battery would be saved little battery life way too early to tell anything will share my experience post one week and one month but they came around charged in the box and have stated to charge the case box says it will take hrs to fully charge it and there are basic indicators like flashing red led for charging which turns solid red once done the earphones also have leds that blink red white to indicate pairing low battery etc sync issues none so far but have seen many such reports and reviews wherein the and earphones seem to go out of sync on similar low price twses so will see if face any such problems these are the primary areas that am concerned with while evaluating any tws so will share how my experience is after while so far happy with them hi my name is akshay used this product and this is very good in sound and valuable money good in calling also everything is perfect good sound quality buds are very good quality with great noise cancellation feature when we received this order box is already opened like this was not expected at all what don like is the earpads sometime it came out don know the reason even tried different fits rest is great amazing sound it is the best choice for the product,neutral
usable for cleaning tech kits good product at this price the microfiber cloths were perfect objects to clean my laptop screen the brush was bit rough and the bristles kind of fans out while cleaning and you need to use your fingers to put it back to your original shape every now and then which is not hygienic haven used the cleaning solution so cannot comment on that well packaged and the product works great everything is nice but brush is not value for money easy to clean laptop and even phone travel friendly products product is good however cloth quality could have better at this price it is bit costly worthable,positive

use it for my macbook pro and the original is so costly for the same performance as for artis service would say that they are excellent and very customer friendly had issues with my charger about month after purchase and had exceeded the return period sought help from them through the warranty registered they just advised me to send the damaged charger to them and on receipt promptly sent me replacement with no other questions asked just the warranty registration and invoice copy very satisfying experience its almost months purchasing the product now doing and last well so far no complaint while charging my laptop this charger gets heated up more than the original charger thats my only concern im using mac book air and this product so far months hasnt diisappointed im not getting the heating issues as said in the comments yet the charging speeds isnt as good as the original one but for quarter the price its okey initially ordered this charger in during the height of the pandemic as the original apple charger seemed too expensive at rs worked well for months before dying and replaced it within warranty the replacement was quick and effective months later replacement died too so ordered new one same story repeated again for months the original one worked and the replacement worked for months it is good charger if you want to use it as an alternative to apple however remember that it costs th so it also works for th the life charges the laptop just as well as the original tldr its like yearly subscription based charger will work well for year then you have to order new one value for money and as far as now its working perfectly quality wise also not that bad the charger is working fine on my macbook inch retina display for the past months,neutral

use it for writing messages or drawing the only con is it reflects light and brightness is less so nothing is visible when lights are out but its very smooth and easy to use like it the price its great erase and different ink poor functions would have completed the package it might be the result of adding additional materials for durability or longetivity who knows but the pen strokes you ll see be little leaky and thicker disadvantage build quality is very poor light weight plastic finishing if children handles the product more carefully brightness very poor skin or finger touch also writing the lcdadvantage price is valuable lock button is useful one you can always trust amazon basics got it yesterday and the quality and feel is good useful one for kindergarten students,positive

used for more than month works hdmi usb well so far not tested the micro sd slots build quality is great using this with my mac book it works fine while using this adapter amazon prime videos can play in resolution on monitor it says the devices not support hd other ports are working fine not problem took this for my macbook pro edition and it is working perfectly all the ports are working fine till now it been month am using it length of the wire is little small it could be little big and the price is also little high it could be under rs then it will justify if you bought mac book air or pro recently and wondering what to do about all the missing ports usb hdmi etc this is your one stop solution tried on my mac book air and it works like charm connected various pen drives disk drives and go flash drive all worked fine very reasonably priced compared to other options yet has fairly good look and feel everything working fine but it doesn works with macbook hdmi when try to connect one plus tv as an extended screen different displays on both but works fine if used as second screen with common display solved my problem got the product on th august this is the initial impression packaging the package received was in good condition it had pre wrapped plastic on the box no complaint about packaging but one thing to note is that no brand name on the packaging although when you open the product the brand name is there on the product build wire length is small to my opinion it has metal build finish and looks premium and sturdy wire quality is also good but at this price should have provided braided cable have tested this product with usb ports connected mouse keyboard external tb ssd ssd does not get disconnected when all usb are connected for confirmation did gb file transfer and no disconnections were noticed note the speed of the data transfer is low did gb file transfer and was getting the max speed of mb with the ssd connected through the usb hub although when did the same file transfer by directly connecting the ssd to the laptop port got speed of mb so if you want to do lot of file transfer better connect it directly and not through the usb hub so far initial impression are good let see how long it last sometimes not detected by mac and quality is not that good,positive
used guiding stickers but in those places bubbles formed shop guy fixed them too good in this price range go for it suggestions to company for perfect position at speaker cut give transparent background of film instead of black colour will be much easier to decide position of it nice the tempered glass looks solid and protective it was difficult to align the glass however the film protecting the tempered glass is black opaque you cant see whether the ear opening aligns with the phones ear piece you can only guess it can be made transparent for better accuracy tempered glass for phone reasonably priced unlike other sellers superb quality feels like actual glass really nice product keep up the good work popio very easy to put it on you may go for cheap tempered glasses but the touch feels different and smooth with popio glasses am using this for weeks now it is very responsive am very happy to use it the only challenge was applying it as its not very easy even with the help of guiding strips they tend to slip but after applying there was no air bubble and screen works smoothly,positive
used it to keep the air inside as clean as possible this model does provide clean air over reasonable sized space if the windows and doors are kept closed great product with capability to reduce dust by approximately if atmosphere pm is ppm it will be reduced to upto ppm inside room only if minimum ventilation is provided to take care the co we generate in my case have found in my area that the ambient has co at ppm if we open one window door to only by mm clearnce the co is being maintained from to ppm with adults inside the room based on wind velocity and direction this adjustment mm clearance was achieved measuring with calibrated stand alone co cum pm measurement meter one more example with above ventilation arrangement the machine is in auto and ambient air pm at ppm room also at ppm the fan speed reached medium sound audible it took some time to reach ppm and then it took min from ppm to ppm now fan speed changed to low speed in auto sound is inaudible this ppm starts increasing gradually to ppm in minutes now fan speed increases to medium again and the cycle repeats as long as outside pm is ppm similarly the fan speed so it sound can be very high if ambient pollution is very high it needs external cleaning of it hepa filter every month based on pollution the sensor may need cleaning every months for accurate readings if sensor mal functions it is to be cleaned first and check before taking to any service center it has simple filter element with spare availability and capable to give atleast times the specified life if we clean the hepa filter element externally with vacuum cleaner regularly it does not have ozone producing uv rays or ion generators which if not properly designed specified to customes not worry may pollute the air with ozone it has particulate count pm meter which is very accurate in addition it change display colour according to pollution zones to know the condition of air in the room the readings were authenticated with above calibrated stand alone meter co pm pm and pm we have to keep it on auto to facilitate to change flow speed based on pollution level it stemperature and humidity meters are also useful update still under warranty it developed some abnormal sound just audible when we go near to it like kitch kitch kitch at lowest speed doubt was on loosening of bottom locknut of fan and sound is ruled out from fan bearings this diagnosis also strengthened by the observation that the above sound disappeared when it is made upside down bottom cover opened side covers opened the bottom grill was moved down by lifting lock with columns and it was found that the button lock nut was in slightly loose condition as anticipated the abnormal sound and mild vibration problems are resolved after tightening the nut with mm tubular spanner already available with me holding the fan nut is self locking type and assembled back but opening of side covers is tricky and risky job some locks may be broken use hand gloves to protect hands from sharp edges they may open in jerky motion have made some top grill locks bottom side open by cutting modification so that can open the panels easily in future however another mi air purifier is working almost continuously without any problem from last years update high abnormal sound observed this time want send it to service center but while lifting some material flied off from grill so when run it upside down many foreign material came out like some bodies of flying ants their wings and one baby lizard now again it is working normal actualy ther is no need of any smart features for an air filter in practicality we just plug and use it yes air quality is improving but it does not reduce any allergic issues really liked the product like how it shows the current aqi has auto mode night mode that is super helpful with baby the air purifier is is quiet filters well and quickly will wait and watch for long term reliability plus the replacement filters are expensive but the seller shipped an item in an open box turned out to be used product filter says remaining meaning it had been used to good extent earlier not sure why second hand items are sold as new works well since months more comments will be updated sooner like because the performance is good and effective very easy to install it works well but pollution level indicator is not reliable and keeps changing number very quickly in vide range so in night you can use night mode,positive

used this product for about months and really had no issues with it until noticed that my internet stopped working after getting it checked found out that the issue was in the ups maybe wiring cable which stopped transmission contacted the customer care and was assisted by mr ankit he was very helpful and asked me to demonstrate the issue in video and tried to ascertain the issue through other checkups too after ascertaining that the issue is in the product he confirmed to get the default product replaced and started the issue and informed me on tentative timelines for the same hoping to receive the replacement soon so that can continue uninterrupted internet have been using this product for the past four months during this tenure had faced no issues initially but roughly after months the power back up started shrinking extremely and the least duration was under minutes thats when contacted the customer support via whatsapp and must say the whole experience with the customer support team was simply surprising they were very polite and helpful throughout the process it was very easy for me to explain the issue to them then at the end of the first conversation itself they arranged replacement for the product since it is just months old they took all the responsibility of the issue and sent me new product which am currently using now the back up am getting is hours which is based on my usage so finally am not sure how often buy product from this brand but will never forget the support received from this this brand cheers purchased the product days back and initial product was not working properly but received replacement for that thanks for immediate response from the support team liked oakter because it indian product and not chinese as of now it working fine and no lag in wi fi connection or speed need to test the recharge capacity when the power goes off will keep you updated after month again by checking the results giving stars as of now this is really good option for those who are primarily concerned about being cut off from online meetings calls due to frequent short term power cuts and are not willing to spend more amount buying an inverter have been using this product since around months and am pretty happy with its backup have been using the product for more than year later purchased second product for my parents home and it was working fine for months however the backup battery stopped working later and the customer support team were quick to respond and swiftly sent me the replacement product product was delivered very promptly and packaging was good using this product just from couple of days and its working as expected very easy to plug use reserving star for longevity of this product will revise my rating after year or so depending on my experience the device doesn support for hours it support only for or hours minutes max on full recharge product is affordable light and good please don fool on hours support capacity resonate ups is better as compared to this this product claims to give backup for upto hours but it wont even give backup for mins claimed warranty and got the new product as well still the same problem they reiterate and say upto hours where they shud mention clearly that it will give backup upto hour not more than that one of the worst customer support services have seen the associates keep repeating the same sentence or copy paste the chat and dont provide solutions totally disappointed and waste of money never recommending anyone to buy their product,positive
useful for dark colour delicate dress what an amazing product was quite sceptical before buying it after reading all these mixed reviews but glad did smoothens out the creases from dresses coats woollens and any fabric which is otherwise non iron able of course you cant expect it to crease out the cotton shirts but it is very handy product especially if you are travelling also the steam sanitises the clothes making them odour free the water tank is small and needs to be re filled again after about clothes but bigger tank would have made it heavy and difficult to operate overall good purchase loving this product while using it does the job pretty well the cons according to me are you cannot use it with clothes placed on horizontal flat surfaces because the water doesnt reach the outlet in the tank if the tank is half empty the alternative is that the dress has to be hanged to cloth hanger and then use the steamer be careful while steaming as it may burn the skin keep you palm at safe distance while steaming the dress this may be an issue when you try to steam the sleeves of the garment and also for flowing dresses not all fabrics can be completely wrinkle free it sometimes leaves more steam and water at times leaving your garment with wet patches the garment feels wet after using the steamer you have to keep filling the tank twice for using it on one top easy to use sturdy and does the job only thing is that it takes time to cool rest of all good its an amazing product and easy to use just hang the cloth somewhere and start using this great product easy to carry foldable and results great an average product but the cost is too high as it doesnt completely satisfy your purpose,positive

usefull for hostal borosil omni kettle is of good quality and serves the purpose highly recommended for every household pros cord length is good cross compatibility with prestige kettle bottoms is nice initially didn fit but started fitting over time as we sometimes use to put it on the prestige bottom out of ignorance volume cons initially the water after heating use to have smell some discoloration on the base of kettle dark lining disclaimer have used two kettles from prestige which were also good enough but both of them burned out one of them within year and has been sent for warranty claim so suppose it is in nature of kettles to stop working after sufficient usage going to try kent transparent one next time shi khel chal rha hai kettles ke saath kya karen zarurat padti hi hai ghar pe good product overall good product except the inside edges at the opening of the kettle is very sharp when you are cleaning it we have to be careful else it will cause cut on the fingers it not working after months money waste liked the kettle very much got the kettle today and its working fine liked the cord length its approximately meters long the temperature knob works smooth haven felt big difference in low and high settings though the lid is nice quality too and made of glass coming to the base it good quality too instructions manual says this kettle can used for making maggie for boiling eggs for brewing tea and it says don use the kettle to boil milk so therr you have it folks you can use this kettle for milk boiling and milk tea purpose found little dent in the inner side on the base but its minute only so no worries says little about quality control but its not trade of really and just as any other stainless steel utensils get stains at the bottom on boiling water this one too so my opinion use soft water and avoid hard water and ohh forgot to mention there is thermoplastic egg tray given with and easy carry stick that you have to assemble overall good buy nice product,positive

ve been an amazon customer since this is without any doubt the best purchase ve ever made if you have polyester polyester cotton acrylic acrylic wool or acrylic polyester clothes you know that after sometime maybe years could be months they will start to pill pilling is those small round blobs on the cloth make the item look old and haggard as if they ve hand me downs well this product will reset it back to its original look and feel it crazy how good it works on socks sweaters mufflers caps gloves fleece jackets fleece pants anything that has artificial fibre composition don but the one with battery because you ll be restricted to the capacity of the battery and when it degrades the product is useless corded is the way to go for me five stars without doubt easy to use and very useful product am very happy made plastic could have been better good product works really well removes lint in one go good to use first time user good very easy to use and it works really well leaves near nd clean fabric after removing the lint completely,positive
ve just started using it can say much about its sturdiness lookwise it does feel sturdy but depending on the usages it will show how long ot will last at all stages one side of the stand doesn fit properly not that perfect one side has little gap quite satisified with the product after about weeks of use value for the money ergonomics is satisfactory but still it needs to be looked into from the looks of it it would have long term durability also this is an awesome product that have purchased till date for my wfh purpose it can hold laptop very well it can be adjusted for different heights grip to the table is really good it helps to view the laptop with required angle easy to carry looks really great on black table classic silver piece packaging is also very good stars got this delivered today and tried it out my laptop is kg and inches bit of heavy machine while the stand held my laptop it did not fit properly because of the laptop weight or the size the front of the laptop raises instead of staying on the padded notches have to move the machine forward bit for it to stay on if you want to use it as simply stand where you set the laptop and use external devices to use it like the mouse gamepad or the keyboard it is fine you can go for it if you want to use the machine itself when on the stand touchpad and keyboard you might face some issues using it directly is making the machine bit wobbly will test it out with heavy work gaming to see how the temperature holds might edit the review and the rating after using it bit the product itself is awesome and in modern day where ease to carry and compact products are preferred it is good choice my only reason to give stars and removing one out of five is the product latches linkages arms that set the level of elevation angle are bit free and can be undone from one of either side with slight jerk while the second side latch supports all the weight in the meantime it is very convenient and compact to carry along with you definitely value for money,positive
verdict solid buy for this price segment in and even for early there are reviews in this section review is days after purchase typos in the review has rectified now and review is days post android beta update these reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in amazon on august before oos update only for jio was enabled via another update is still not available in my region hence related parameters are not covered in this review review after about days of oxygen os beta update android update received on dec note after the beta update no new issues popped up there were no heating related issues no fast battery drain no change in the charging time no annoying bugs no change in camera performance beta update is mostly like stable update oos android update review delighters no new apps added absolutely not system storage consumption remains the same gb animations are more fluidic more customization ui features added scout widgets in home screen enlarged folder lot more daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier slight improvement in the front ambient light sensor ability to play videos in the background screen off as well even for you tube really welcoming longing feature which other brand uis have not or only with screen off stand by battery life has improved substantially disappointers brightness at lowest level is brighter than before no improvement in sound levels still initial is too silent no dolby atomos which was mentioned for oos perhaps to wait for stable update auto brightness latency is higher than earlier response time is tad increased haptics have become tighter than earlier but still not stronger review verdict good buy in this price range in note this review is after month usage received updates during the course of time recent update was of gb system consumes gb space gb variant is pretty adequate for normal usage band is missing for the unit bought does not have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue shifting from hz to this hz mobile no noticeable difference observed in non gaming aspect nothing great or noting worse in the unmentioned parameters things that are delighting exceptional signal reception especially carrier aggregation very fast download speeds insane fast charging to in mins to in mins excluding trickle charge no heating of the mobile just slight warming during charging stand by charge and so is fantastic even more than hrs for videos yt and general tasks and calls even in mobile data always on and aod set to battery saver oxygen os color os realme os bloatware the skin is really good nothing to complain like other brands ui absolutely no rd party bloatware and no ads in the ui or any nd party apps even some nd party apps are un installable no major bothering bugs noticed till date yes the alert slider is included unlike some premium one plus models things that are annoying dual ambient light sensor in rear and other in front is not well calibrated the brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required volume level is useless until level can be audible only in pin drop silence ambience audible enough only post level stereo speakers output are bottom and earpiece but full volume doesn distort is loud enough haptics are tight but not strong even in higher levels effective only post and best only level hotspot drains battery quickly even warning notification pops up also chrome and google app eats away battery quickly parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm though the in hand feel is good the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles bit data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel the inbuild dac no mm hole and only type port is not great the dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output perhaps dolby atmos support in oos could improve the audio output overall it good mobile phone the speed and interface is all good but expect battery to last long not much always keep it in battery saving mode and work for about hours on normal use not many themes available samsung is better in that sense there are many wallpapers and themes available display is clear and camera is also good overall okay got this mobile gb gb ram variant at after discount on icici credit card for this price it must buy am using this product since last weeks the camera is pretty good and the screen and sterio speakers are also working very well the only complaint can say is the battery life could have been better as working professional it doesn makes lot difference for me but who is heavy user they will need to charge it twice day if you have no issues with the battery section then just go for it battery drains like any thing rest all good have to recharge twice day don buy if you want good battery backup even though phone is fast charge am disappointed with battery life bought gb and and it working very smoothly for normal regular use you can go for it there is problem with temper glass part front cemera area temper glass not installing good but not so fast as think gb it ordinary like gb apart from battery and sound quality everything else is good,positive

very bad performance even for normal work even this model is not mentioned under their official website tried many times to contact customer care no response good product but pekeging not good am not reviewing this as per gaming experience but per daily heavy use find it very helpful for me who use mouse whole day with lot of left and right clicks drag and drops scrolls and scroll clicks didn find any glitches so far works perfectly for me about looks it looks beautiful almost like small pet who can change colour but it can be little disturbing if you are using it in dark otherwise the best thing is it doesn need any installation headaches only reason deducted one star is because this mouse is little oversized for my hand so people with little hands will struggle at first but eventually with time and use you will feel like it shrank like zebronics because trust their products if you are thinking of buying it go for it good mouse not the best but good enough good its good but idk if its only with me but the mouse sometimes becomes unresponsive not for long tho just seconds overall would recommend good mouse little heavyweight,positive

very happy with the product performance installation very easy to start using had to wait for days for the technician but with the instructions from box you can start yourself without waiting in the box disposable mops washable mops side brushes main brush mopping plate deebot dust chamber with hepa filter charging dock cable user manual cleaning brush cleaning performance superb cleaning with power options quiet normal max and max lower suction means lower battery consumption with higher suction power even the minutest dust particles will be cleaned up good if you have children in the house higher suction also means you need to clean the dust chamber more frequently in all the power options the house will look clean and will collect most visible dust the higher options are for deep cleaning also if you have groves or areas that accumulate dust over time in the flooring the higher power will pull out dust from these tiny places cleaning pattern st edges of the room are cleaned and then it will run north south or east west cleaning pattern inside the edges no specific patterns like or spiral mopping performance the mopping also has electronically controlled water usage low medium high ultra high the app shows warnings when using high and ultra high the robot may slip due to water on the floor but have been using high water flow on ceramic tiles and have not faced such problem the wheels of the robot have good grip which help with the higher water settings the mopping will become more and more effective over time with usage of the reusable mopping pad as it gets older more area will touch the floor than new mopping pad for the st week the mopping is not as good as the mopping pad does not entirely touch the floor but with usage the shape of pad will adapt and you will get better results corner cleaning cms of wall corners may not be cleaned esp if you don have straight walls if you have bathroom door which has cm cutout in the wall then the corner area around the door might not be cleaned degree wall corners may have cm area which is not cleaned however the side brushes are large enough for most of these corners all other areas with obstacles such as chair or table legs will be properly cleaned deebot may run around them or times corner mopping as the deebot mop is round it will not reach the corners expect cm area in the degree wall corners not being mopped however on straight walls the cleaning is very effective as it may only miss cms which however will be cleaned by side brushes important if you have black furniture black stone wall tiles mirrors or any reflective furniture at the height where deebot top mounted laser is located the corner area near that black furniture will not be cleaned by deebot the laser is not able to properly recognize that it is wall and will run few centimeters away from that wall this is important to consider if you have substantial amount of blacks in your house as the cleaning will be less effective mapping the st run will map the entire house and you need to follow deebot as it maps so that no areas are obstructed subsequent runs will update the map with any obstacles chairs and tables if they were not initially mapped the version does not have additional sensors as the pro version so it may crash into smaller items that the top mounted laser cannot directly see also you can save at maximum of maps at time floors the st run will be very random cleaning pattern after the st run you can edit the rooms divide or merge areas and rename the rooms based on some preset options like living room bed room kitchen etc once the rooms are mapped deebot will clean each room in the subsequent run and then you will be able to see proper cleaning pattern the created maps are not editable you cannot move or adjust boundaries you have option to add virtual boundaries as line or as rectangle box where the robot should not go this is extremely useful if you have mirrors or reflecting furniture at the height of deebot deebot laser reflects off the mirrors and assumes there is area of the house where it may be able to go behind the mirror so you need to manually block this mapped area behind the mirror with virtual boundary or box deebot will automatically detect carpets and not mop over them if you have installed mopping plate then deebot will ignore carpet area also there is an option to mark areas as no mop areas similar to virtual boundary application use used the android application for setup and regular cleaning functions the app has an advanced mode which works as per the stored map if you turn it off deebot will start cleaning wherever you place it have balcony which can be accessed by the deebot directly can pickup and place it in the balcony turn advanced mode off and start cleaning once it is done it will return to the place where you put it and notify that docking station is not accessible the app also has cleaning modes with advanced mode turned on area cleaning select room or multiple rooms to clean auto clean clean the entire house custom cleaning select an area on the map to clean you can preset the sequence in which you want to clean the rooms you can also set different vacuum and water levels for each room or can use common setting for the entire house you can also preset how many times options are once or twice you want to clean specific room you can also set multiple cleaning schedules based on which room you want to clean at what time of the day deebot will start working automatically however this is not advisable if you are mopping as per the technician you must remove mopping plate after use if any water leaks onto the parts it may void warranty there is an option to auto boost suction on carpets to max you can set the option for continuous cleaning whether you want deebot to auto restart cleaning if it runs out of charge midway deebot will only recharge partially based on the remaining cleaning area resume the cleaning and then return to recharge this saves time the app also shows usage period of accessories in hours and the total expected usage time it is an ecovacs recommendation to replace the accessories side brush main brush hepa filter this area of the app also shows how to clean or maintain with images which is really helpful the app shows history of cleaning cycles with maps this helps to check if any areas were not cleaned cleaning and maintenance expect that instead of cleaning the house daily you will be washing the mopping pad every day and cleaning deebot once every week depending on the size of your house cleaning will take around to minutes remove all hairs from side brush main brush and wheels remove the dust chamber remove the hepa filter and wash the dust chamber wash the main and side brushes if needed clean all the sensors of deebot with dry cloth let the washed accessories dry and then reinstall them also remember that the investment in robot is not onetime cost you will need to replace the accessories every months based on the usage and maintenance consider the replacement cost also while evaluating price point for investment in robot vacuum overall

very nice efficiency is good cost is little more compared to it competitors product quality is good but after sales support from lg local services center are grossly disappointing don misread into the installation charges you will be in for surprise with discrepancies on installation charges please ensure you check with lg installation service team before hand product is good and no issues with cooling or any other functionality the installation was expensive amazon installation says tax but the total installation cost is tax stand cost others also the copper wire was missing and the lg installation person told that need to contact amazon and they will reimburse called amazon customer care and they said they will reimburse upto the wire costed me some amazon reimbursement is in form of amazon pay balance so actually ended up paying cash as below to the lg installation installation cost wire cost total amazon should look into why copper wires are missing from packages it seems to be regular issue as installation guys were aware of it even before opening the package it is un necessary issue and headache for customer buying from amazon good noisy at full speed fan mode but quiet enough at medium to low fan speed cooling is good and features are more than enough for normal use room temperature display is useful remote is good enough overall no complains everything is good and fine love it,positive

vfm indoor use living room bedrrom use and clear view upto sqft rooms configuration is pretty easy for any novice night mode is good as well only flaw feel is that the head portion is bulky while its resting stand is not heavy leading to the camera movements if not screwd down best camera impressed me video quality is osome but the app lags like it it is very compact product that can fit almost anywhere the only drawback is that most of the features that it offers are cloud based and requires you to pay to avail them features like rich notification where the phone notifications also contain screenshot when the motion is detected should have been included as part of free service at least when connected to the same wifi as of now the only free notification that you get is an alert with the date and time the motion was detected and you need to open the app and wait for it to load up before knowing what motion had occured ai motion detection also should have been locally available free feature instead of relying on cloud the normal motion detection is not very perfect and has few false positives also web ui would have been nice to have instead of relying only on the tapo app to view and configure the settings overall as normal ip camera with recording this is great but most features that it provides requires paid cloud connectivity which was disappointing and it lacks web ui hence would recommend that you check other brands before deciding to buy this very good for small shops or indoor for house care it was definitely not new sealed product it looked like returned product resold to me it was dusty inside original stickering worn out etc but the product works am ok with it tapo cam is very good and working as expected and gb sd card can record upto days and continue in loop mode we can see person and motion detection events,positive

was looking for durable cable for my ipad cause the cable apple provides in the box feels pretty flimsy and doesn really inspire confidence also use my ipad primarily for gaming so it is almost always connected to my pc while gaming so needed really sturdy cable that could charge sync and and feel good while doing it and this cable does the job perfectly it is sturdy my ipad has taken few drops my table and was saved my this cable even after months of daily abuse this cable has no signs of wear and tear the charge speed is the same as the original apple cable and so is the sync speed one thing this cable does better than the original cable is the connection quality it hardly ever accidentally breaks the connection while moving around too much which was problem with my original cable very satisfied with the purchase and even have spare one in case of an emergency quality cable material it feels durable charges my phone just fine thanks amazon the product is good build quality is good and does what said in the description of the product but it stopped working within months of usage the prod was ordered in apr and now in sept its not charging the phone at all have contacted amazon for the same and looking forward for their help used it as back up to charge phone in car apple car play has stopped working intermittently when using this cable good product but phn was getting heat while its chrgeing this cable is working great its durable and charging power is also good recommended,positive
was looking for phone below am not person who believes to burn money for phones my requirement was phone that has good network reception good wifi reception balanced software good battery life good screen that don strain eyes good hardware mm headphone jack and charger don need network because drains battery lot and spends too much data don watch movie or yt on mobile network and wonder how many does watch fhd videos over mobile network for downloading documents social networks banking apps is more than enough in my budget found all phones have gb ram realme narzo was during gif and had all those features along with good processor and another one was redmi note but found that if can extend my budget little more with all coupons and bank offer can get redmi note with gb ram at gb ram is always preferred over gb ram because nobody knows whether with future updates the os would demand more ram or not also the softwares may require more ram as time passes away so this was the only option knew then available redmi note has amoled display am not bothered with hz hz hz keep the refresh rate at hz and display works without zero lag or stutter all my desktop screen has hz refresh rate and am happy with them so why do need hz screen think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers the display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich you can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but think standard is fine for me also you can calibrate display colours in settings but think you don need that display size is inch it could have been better if it were inch prefer big display phone redmi note has that big display plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and am happy with that the screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with damp cloth the screen has punch hole camera which looks good this phone duel speakers one is more powerful at bottom and another on top but think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or yt bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good what more do you expect from such tiny speakers the phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience can say my phone and wifi modem stays at different floor still get good signal and never disconnected voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear however because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phone the phone has ah battery and comes with charger which is bonus at this price point the battery gives long backup with good mobile network you can use it for days without charging using basic features like phone sms email fb wa etc but charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below the phone has sd processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag the experience is butter smooth however the apps get automatically cleared from ram which like because don have to clear ram manually however after android update the ram hold app for longer time but eventually cleared sd doesn heat up and it is very energy efficient because of that battery drains very little and charger charges phone within mins for my usage the cable is usb to and feels good this phone has ir blaster so in your home office you can control ac or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailable this phone has ddr ram and ufs storage the ram is gb and can be expanded additional gb as virtual ram by occupying storage but have disabled that option from settings because it increases ssd life this has sim sd card slot which is great both sim have vo lte and carrier aggregation the phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive some people may complain about plastic but remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones and have no problem with plastic don think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap am happy with plastic back the phone also gives tpu cover and the cover however yellowing after month this is inherent chemistry of tpu and no one can prevent this chemical degradation how ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlight the fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly the touch screen is excellent too however dont like some of the preinstalled apps some can be uninstalled few can especially mi pay and getapps from mi store don like them however like the pre installed security app there is no ad in notification and all can be easily disabled camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good does not show pictures like mp camera have added some pictures clicked by redmi note back camera mi ui is fluid and has many user friendliness like one ui mi ui is now free of bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the user so give redmi score of this is an excellent phone the got at during great indian festival recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone this phone is not for gamers or people who watch videos or shoot such things this is not or those who are crazy for otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment days usage good battery life bqest for day day use charger also good best display but should ve hz instead of sturdy in hand feel stereo speaker is loud and crisp split camera above average but good concerning the price buggy ui minor as expected but ui all way better than bloody miui chipset sd which is fine always available some minor issue with wi fi reception don know may be they will fix it through ota this phone is for people who clicks photos here there casual gamer binge watchers of web shows movies not intended for heavy gaming not for pubg cod lovers the first look of this starbust design is eye catchy no word to express its design in hand feel and and it all physical dimension the second this which impress me it battery backup even you playing game hardly for long time it gives you sufficient battey backup and charging speed also is also good deal at this price the third impressive factor is it dual speaker have an another phone of and the sound quality is almost same as it media playback experience is also enhanced by it amoled display very colour charming display literally the display quality is unbeatable the camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience other performance like gaming is also good at this price point fingerprint button is also very responsive all other things and features are good to the price point only one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower grade even my old redmi which exchanged with this had better camera than this so plz request you to all don buy this for camera just don the images are shown of camera pictures on the website is illustration according to me don recommend you to buy this phone as your camera phone if you are non camera user then you will surely go for it pros design in hand feel battery and charging amoled display dual speaker cons camera quite smooth daily driver phone the overall experience has been satisfactory camera good durability also seems to be good ve dropped it quite few times the gorilla glass seems to be holding up hz feels great charging speed is good too nothing mind blowing though battery life is decent lasts quite bit but since keep it in the hz mode all the time it little less for me but don have any problem with battery life for now it does what the description says camera quality not upto the mark compared to other redmi mobiles even model clicks better pics finger print sensor is same as that of the lock button you need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint read volume is good for both call and streaming fast charging but charger gets heated soon battery back up is good unless you don do heavy gaming and all day video sreaming dual app and dual space option is missing light weight and good video resolution overall good for learning students for online sessions and persons with less need for photography gaming bought this for my dad and it working good for him if you are planning to give it to your parents or elderly people in your family just install third party launcher and hide unnecessary app aslo turn off spamming notification and lockscreen ads overall good phone for elders or first time smartphone user phone is good but facing weird bugs due to software issues after that manually installed latest global software then working fine when was using indian firmware after the update the phone got into bootloop every sec but after manual installation its working fine,positive

when purchased this watch thought it couple be used to send sms make calls access notifications without being connected to the phone knew that third party notifications required the phone to be connected to the internet but thought the watch could place calls and send texts even if the phone is switched off the product ordered can only make calls when disconnected from the phone features such as sms surprising since this is an lte version and notifications this includes watch apps such as outlook that require internet are only synced with the watch on it is connected to the phone via bluetoothi did not check other features as the main reason ordered this watch was accessibility to notifications without phone have been using this since june it looks good on the wrist and has all useful features like calling reading and replying whatsapp messages the battery is too low though keep it switched off at night never used it to track sleep yet have to charge every couple of days plus it gets charged slow all features of the watch is good but battery backup is very poor after full charge it runs hours but after average uses it will run hours only it amazing with the lte function now don lug my phone to the gym but the battery life sucks and have to charge twice specially when use lte also it heats for some reason and needs to cool down once in while that time the watch automatically goes into hibernation and starts after some time positives are accuracy sleep tracking monitor remote lte connection wears amazing on the wrist great screen negative battery life using it for month fits well have wireless charger you can also charge it from your phone if your phone supports wireless charging one thing which is common to most smart watches is when you re traveling in bus or car in bumby road it will assume you are jogging and congratulate you for completing daily tasks charging is too slow which is to be expected unless you have samsung flagship phone you won be able to see camera app on the watch and you ll have to get third party applications and they re just horrible product is good pros health accuracy is high ui is good design and build quality is also good con app is not that good and facing connectivity issues good,positive

while it makes enough froth under mins tested using amul taaza milk warmed at deg celcius the battery holder is too narrow for eneloop aa rechargeable batteries did not know this hence one of the batteries got stuck in battery compartment ultimately it had to be pried out by tweezers now that have peeled the outer covers of my eneloops to slightly reduce the diameters can insert and remove them however still cannot close the flimsy battery door have to hold and press it while operating it of course there is zero problem if you use costly duracells still the battery insertion process is not at all user friendly one has to watch youtube videos for that to reduce spillage use tall coffee mugs while frothing not as strong and powerful to froth the coffee quality is good average product very easy to use house coffee looks like restaurant coffee too much frothy worth it this is the first time writing review about any product this is the best frother at affordable cost works well and the product is good for this price looks delicate and not sure of sturdiness though will updare for durability works good coffee making is faster,neutral
wifi ability to connect with the printer is not very good did my first print and ink gone quickly as water evaporates under sun lol doing an exchange good products and very good print quality the printer came loosely put into the hp printer box without any of the usual styrofoam packing it was rattling in the box before being opened after couple of days of very light use probably no more than pages both printer cartridges ran low and the black already ran out had to replace it when was installing the printer had noticed that the cartridges did not have the protective tape over them didnt think much of it then it feels like this was printer that was being used somewhere and they put it into new box when shipping or someone opened new box inserted used cartridges and took out the new ones the scanner also does not seem to work the printing is fine and works think the problem is with the company that sold and shipped it to me somethings amiss here it nice but take time to installation which cause trouble at once after that it easy to use best one for home need got delivered today and set up using the cable and fired few prints print quality is good need to see how long the catridge lasts but for home purpose and medium usage think it works there is some serious issue with the product it is not working now need service engineer to repair it,neutral

would not consider buying an phone simply because my friend owns two of them or blindly go for new android model suggested by my son or nephew both of whom are more tech savvy than me because their recommendations are obviously based on their own needs and expectations which may differ from mine am an old fashioned mechanical engineer with basic understanding of parameters like millimetres megapixels and megabytes but think of cellphone as utility item not status symbol applying technocratic approach would not choose costlier option unless get additional features which suit my requirements my foremost requirement which is entirely non negotiable is that my handset must have provision for two sim cards since do not want to carry two separate handsets for my cug and personal numbers my other requirements are not difficult to fulfil phonebook with at least contacts basic net connectivity basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading few apps such as the ubiquitous whats app and my favourite word games which do not need much memory or processing capacity would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability software and security updates and high battery capacity sufficient for hours or preferably hours at my normal level of usage besides would like to use new handset for at least two years apart from exigencies do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the internet videoconferencing or sending mails as prefer using desktop or laptop for such activities am equally clear about what do not need do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies reading books listening to music or creating fancy social media posts nor do want device for taking high resolution photos during vacation as would prefer to use camera at the risk of sounding flippant would say that do not want device to unlock my car or count the strokes in game of golf primarily because do not own car and do not play golf having used smartphones of samsung and motorola makes over the past few years vastly prefer the former my last phone which gave me over months of good service was samsung since that model is obsolete now focused on its upgraded cousins and the last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two sim cards along with an sd card after studying the relative specifications of and concluded that the latter offers better value for money generally it is worth going for the higher memory and higher ram versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small with these considerations narrowed down my choice to with gb ram and gb storage just twenty years ago was using desktop with gb memory as confirmation for my choice compared the phone had selected with one plus nord ce gb ram gb storage which my son had recommended the specification of the samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters except that the display screen technology was tft instead of amoled also watched some youtube videos about these handsets for better appreciation of their competing features the clinching factor was that the samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the one plus product as for body colour my first choice was emerald brown but settled for the mystique green since the former was not available in my selected configuration was thinking this would be irrelevant since use case which completely encloses the handset but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phone despite strong family resemblance with my old one the new phone offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly it is few millimetres longer and few grams heavier than my old phone but these differences are acceptable to me thanks to the mp front camera and mp selfie camera the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations see sample pic taken at night at distance of about metres from the stage this phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates which reduces the worries on these fronts youtube reviewers complain that the has plain looks it is heavy its audio does not offer an immersive listening experience and its screen is plain old tft instead of amoled am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings so long as the meets my requirements was glad to find that samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers because old chargers like old handsets add to waste however it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers the recommended charger for is watts but the chargers had at home are rated at or watts to cut long story short ordered watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time after using the new handset for couple of weeks find that my phone is at charge at the end of the day and it takes minutes for complete charging one of the useful features of is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging it turns out that could have managed with the old watt charger except that it would have taken minutes for full charging conclude by emphasizing that samsung galaxy is the perfect phone but for my requirements word of advice if you are planning to buy new phone it would be helpful if you list out your requirements so that you do not end up paying for features that you do not intend to use with connectivity hz display and solid performance the galaxy is samsungs best value smartphone yet under segment pros almost half the price of galaxy exynos is solid performer excellent hz display with smooth experience across the board huge performance uplift over one ui based on android has tons of good features to love none of the flagship grade features are skipped here apart from dex mode and spen features zero lag or stuttering in hz mode with ease of use and seemless switching of apps without any crash or reloading of apps makes using one ui pleasure to surf across you get features like screen recorder video call effects game launcher link to windows dual messenger quick share music share and secure folder along with many others some of the fancy android features like the ability to change the color palette of icons and menus based on the wallpaper and dim the screen for easier reading in the dark are also included voice focus for calls is excellent feature phone call quality is really good even in nosiy and crowded areas had no issues with gps or connectivity while using google maps to navigate signal stays strong even in rural areas thats positive point with good accuracy volte with carrier aggregation works flawlessly wifi connectivity on the dual band ghz router is strong and performs more than satisfactorily with low latency response bluetooth connectivity is strong and has good range no worries of disconnection even as far as meters audio quality via mm jack is excellent compared to redmi note pro much more defined and well rounded for media consumption widewine support is present good av experience on ott platforms have no serious complaints about color reproduction in videos considering tft lcd this panel does good enough job main camera mp is on par and better than redmi note pro in almost all conditions retains colors close to reality with good dynamic range and handling of exposure with hdr in photos as well as videos it is able to handle extremely bright conditions well even in shadows during day time it was able to maintain good colors good stable videos at video recording is available at fps is available many cool camera features boasts ar fun mode single take object eraser and video tnr temporal noise reduction which makes it fun to use camera selfie camera has good punchy colors samsung way of boosted colour processing some may like it some may not excellent battery life got hours of sot despite the heavy usage it takes around hours to go from and half an hour of charging can take the battery percentage to around provided you have watt samsungs charger despite summer time phone has managed to stay relatively cool nm architecture helping its cause here bands dedicated sd card slot is plus here pd watt fast charging support reasonable for price segment but we have seen faster charging speeds with other oems promised major android os updates and years security updates is huge plus above its competitors making this device more value for money in long run cons ultrawide camera is on softer side lacks details compared to its primary sensor but manages to frame good shots that one can post on social media macro camera is good with colors and edge detection but lacks depth of field and details note pro which is brilliant in this case night shots are above average mostly grainy and muddled but better than most smartphones in its segment lacks some stability in video recording at amoled display could have made it unbeatable lacks stereo speaker but audio quality on single speaker is quite good pre installed bloatwares like moj dailyhunt sharechat byju are mild and uninstallable but makes mature one ui experience looks immature out of the box currently device is not tunned for high gaming performance as limited fps in popular games like bgmi and cod deters it away from being gamer friendly device but we can expect exynos to resolve over time and be more optimized for more games in future updates slightly cheap design chunky in size carries some heft dated notch display lack of charger in the box is bummer which adds up to the value cost proposition,positive

yeah here is the honest review looking good quality is okay not an defective product but not satisfied with the phone holder it is too straight because understand the reality every one will like and feel comfortable when the phone holder is little slope that comfort is not there and added the picture of my vision of the phone on the holder too straight it is difficult to see and write the phone holder is the main purpose for what buy this but that is not suitable for me but the quality of the table is good cushion grip is coming out tab phone holder is not useful phone tab holder doesn give an angular slant for clear view it also has small diameter that could not hold broad tab or phone quality stability light weight easy to carry these some good points of product such nice bed studying table this is very comfortable you must be buy it not sturdy on the bed material is cheap not as expected,positive
yeap this cable support fast charging tested on my brick of realme pro cable and pins quality looks good since couldnt find original cable for charger of realme was searching for long time for good one charging speed depends on number of factors and only in best condition it will go above watts and the brand only claims that watts fast charge if only you use the brand inbox charger for me personally tested out at multiple occassion using it for month or two never got speed above watt and tested it with the cable that received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if you re conditions are good and you get speed more tha watss then only you should buy it or you should go with cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables the cable supports fast charging using one plus charger as advertised if it could have been round and braided instead of flat ribbon cable that would make it more durable in my experience braided cables are easy to wrap and store when not in use and they dont get frayed easily my cable stopped fast charging after two months of usage but warranty support was excellent submitted the cable at nearby centre and new cable was shipped within days ve been using boat cables for about years now cable from moto phone is still with me and in use and will stick to them got the original one but there are fake cables being sold so beware it warp charges as it supports power supply the cable is long and sturdy compared to the typical one plus cable in the box the price of original one plus cable is mrp but this got for and is not unlike other third party wires definitely worth it best in price segment and durable material tangle free alsi amazon send me used product but the cable is super and support fast charging and the quality is also good but they sent me used product by others if not it super product and year of warranty on it just buy it very good quality fast charging cable getting good quick charging through laptop also flat cable design makes it more durable have one plus with watts charge my original wire had been destroyed few years ago and was searching for cable with for fast charging had buyed many wires but the phone was not charging as fast as he original one this wire has good build quality and can do watts,positive

you can use android iso devices mouse is very good but bluetooth option can support in macbook pro update have received the replacement mouse for the replacement mouse it seems to work fine till date sometimes it hangs and have to restart it but compared to previous ones it is fine not reliable but the customer service and replacement has been good would recommend the product if you have backup mouse with you as it is not completely reliable update the replacement mouse broke within days it stopped working completely and the mouse cursor doesn even move asked for refund but they are sending me another mouse after testing it for week am losing hope update contacted their whats app customer service number they arranged for replacement immediately and received it after week had to use an old mouse in the mean time used to trust offbeat products but am greatly disappointed as this mouse broke just after two weeks the mouse pointer moves erratically on it own the return window closed two days ago and can return this broken garbage will file complaint to consumer court if am not refunded good use apple magic mouse regularly which is superior one for obvious reasons stylist design it supports gestures battery backup is unparallel this offbeat mouse is almost as per in terms of ergonomics and design we can not expect this mouse to support gestures at this price point and innovation but does the job well the good part is you have dual modes of connecting dongle and bluetooth decorative lights are plus tested this mouse connecting to mac book and works all well for battery and charging am not able to comment yet as not used for long term overall happy buy good battery life adjustable dpi works well easy to use switch devices bluetooth is sorted rgb has low illumination basic everyday use bluetooth mice it good product using it since months happy with the battery life quality could ve been better no issues so far and quality is good liked the design too,positive
you have to get used to changes in flavours as compared to fried foods device is easy to use and clean best product for chicken roast good product but the capacity is sufficient only for nuclear families and you will need to cook grill times can do it at one go damaged packaging so check thoroughly before use the product us useful beyond doubt needs very little oil now it been month for using this airfyer and overall experience is good buy only when you are healthy diet specific and nonveg would be plus as for veg it could be limited dishes you can prepare very good product one of the best buy ever and of course the brand made by air fryer awsome product quick to use and worth the money,positive
